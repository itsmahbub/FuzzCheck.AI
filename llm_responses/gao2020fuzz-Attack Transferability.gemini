  "why": "The paper proposes a data augmentation technique, SENSEI, to improve the robustness of a single Deep Neural Network (DNN) model during its training phase. The method uses a genetic algorithm to generate high-loss variants of training inputs, which are then immediately used to train that same model. The entire process of generating and utilizing these 'fault-inducing' inputs is self-contained within the training loop of one specific model. The experiments evaluate the robustness of multiple individual models after they have been trained with SENSEI, but they do not test whether the variants generated for one model can cause failures in other models performing the same task. The paper does not mention or evaluate the concept of attack transferability between different models.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Algorithm 2, 'Overall algorithm': The algorithm describes a training process for a single model 'M'. In each epoch, for each training input 'X[i]', variants are generated and evaluated using the current model 'M' (line 14: `f := fitness(M, children);`). The model 'M' is then retrained on the augmented data (line 19: `M := train(X, Y);`). This shows the generated inputs are specific to and consumed by the model being trained, not transferred to other models.\n\nPage 7, Section 4.3, 'Evaluation Metric': The paper's own evaluation metric is defined for a single model's performance: 'A DNN is robust around x if and only if M(x') = c for all x' ∈ X'. This confirms that the evaluation is focused on the robustness of an individual model, not on cross-model failure patterns.\n\nPage 9, Table 2, 'The robust accuracy for Random, W-10 and SENSEI': This table presents the results for 15 different models. Each model is trained and evaluated independently. The methodology does not involve generating inputs on one model (e.g., GTSRB-1) and testing them on another (e.g., GTSRB-2)."
