  "why": "The paper introduces CrossASR++, a black-box differential testing framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. The primary objective and the entire evaluation of the proposed method are focused on the efficiency and effectiveness of *finding* failures, measured by the quantity of failed test cases uncovered. The paper does not provide any diagnostic analysis to explain *why* these failures occur. It treats the ASR systems as black boxes, so there is no analysis of model internals (e.g., neuron activation, coverage). Furthermore, it does not perform any statistical analysis on the discovered failure patterns (e.g., common phonetic errors, sentence structures causing failure) or attempt to link them to underlying model vulnerabilities like dataset bias or overfitting. The experiments exclusively report the number of failed test cases found under different configurations.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3, EXPERIMENTS: The paper's evaluation is structured around two research questions that exclusively target the quantity of failures discovered: 'RQ1. How many failed test cases can CrossASR++ find?' and 'RQ2. To what extent do enhanced features help find more failed test cases?'. The results presented in tables (e.g., Table 1) and the accompanying text only report the counts of failures. For example, the paper states: 'In total, CrossASR++ can find 26.2% more failed test cases than the original tool, which demonstrates significant improvements to the original tool.' This demonstrates that the evaluation's goal is to count failures, not to diagnose their root cause."
