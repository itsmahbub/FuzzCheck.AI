  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The method, DRFuzz, utilizes a set of 16 mutation rules categorized into 'Pixel-Level Mutation' (e.g., adding Gaussian noise, shuffling patches) and 'Image-Level Mutation' (e.g., scaling, rotating, brightness adjustment). The 'Image-Level' mutations are semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations. The metric definition explicitly states that applying such transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization results in a 'Medium' rating. The paper does not mention any mechanism to account for I/O effects such as quantization, rounding, or clipping that occur during standard file saving operations (e.g., to PNG). The 'Pixel-Level' mutations, which introduce small numerical changes, are particularly susceptible to being lost or altered during such I/O operations. Since the fuzzing process and oracle evaluation are performed on in-memory representations without considering serialization effects, the method does not qualify for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section C, Mutation Rules: \"In DRFuzz, we adopt all the mutation rules for images designed by the existing work [11], [27], [28]... In total, we implemented 16 mutation rules in DRFuzz... According to the usage of each mutation rule, we classify them into two categories, i.e., Pixel-Level Mutation and Image-Level Mutation.\"\n\nPage 4, Table I, \"MUTATION RULES\": This table lists the specific mutation operators. The 'Pixel-Level Mutation' rules include 'Pixel Adding Gaussian Noise' and 'Pixel Adding Salt & Pepper Noise'. The 'Image-Level Mutation' rules include 'Image Rotating' and 'Image Brightness Adjustment', which are examples of semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations."
