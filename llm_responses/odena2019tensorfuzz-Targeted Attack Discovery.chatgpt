  "why": "TensorFuzz is built around user-defined objective functions and is demonstrated to steer exploration toward broader classes of problematic behaviour (e.g., numerical errors/NaNs, model vs quantized-model disagreements, broken loss-function states). The paper does not present or demonstrate steering the fuzzer toward attacker-chosen specific outputs (for example, forcing a classifier to emit a particular label or forcing a speech model to utter a particular phrase). Thus the method supports discovery of broader security- or correctness-violating behaviours rather than targeted, adversary-chosen outputs.",
  "evidence": "Section 5 (Objective Function), p.4: \"The objective function is used to assess whether that state has been reached. ... The objective function is applied to the metadata arrays, and flags inputs that caused the objective to be satisfied. In this way, the objective function asserts the property to be tested and the fuzzer attempts to find a violation of this property.\" | Section 6 (Experimental Results), p.5: \"TensorFuzz can efficiently find numerical errors in trained neural networks... We focus on finding inputs that result in not-a-number (NaN) values.\" | Section 6 (Experimental Results), p.6: \"TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions... With these settings, the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried.\" | No statement in the paper demonstrates or claims steering to attacker-chosen specific outputs (e.g., \"inducing a classifier to predict a chosen label\"), and all concrete examples target classes of failures (NaNs, disagreements, broken loss behavior) rather than predetermined specific outputs."
