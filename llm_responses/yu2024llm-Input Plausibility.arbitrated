  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper incorporates mechanisms to enforce semantic plausibility during each mutation step—namely, LLM-assisted Generate/Crossover/Expand/Shorten/Rephrase operators—and penalizes overly deep mutation chains via reward discounting and early‐termination in the MCTS-Explore seed selection (Algorithm 1). However, it does not provide any explicit empirical evaluation of the final fault-inducing prompts’ plausibility (no human studies or quantitative metrics such as perplexity or semantic-similarity scores are reported). Thus, while plausibility is enforced in mutation design and some mitigation against cumulative drift is applied, there is no empirical validation of final-input realism, matching the “Medium” level.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.3 Mutation (page 4662): “To maintain the semantic correctness of newly generated prompts, we have introduced five innovative mutation operators that harness LLMs… ” and Figure 3 qualitative examples; Algorithm 1 Update (page 4661): reward ← max(reward − α*len(path),β) and early-termination to limit deep mutation chains; Section 4.1 Metrics (page 4664): defines JQN, ASR, EASR, QBC, TBC with no mention of human evaluation or task-specific measures (e.g., perplexity, SSIM) to assess input plausibility."
