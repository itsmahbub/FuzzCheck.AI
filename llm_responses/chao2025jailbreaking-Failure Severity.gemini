  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper introduces PAIR, a method explicitly designed to generate \"semantic jailbreaks\" that bypass the safety guardrails of large language models. The evaluation is conducted on a range of modern, safety-aligned LLMs, including Llama-2, GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, which are described as representing the state-of-the-art in safety alignment. The goal is to induce the models to produce objectionable content for harmful behaviors, which constitutes a high-impact failure by bypassing explicit safety mechanisms. This aligns perfectly with the 'High' severity rating, which is defined by uncovering failures that bypass explicit safety mechanisms in defended or safety-aligned models to induce violations like jailbreaks.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"The alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. ... we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM.\"\n\nPage 4, Section IV. EXPERIMENTS, Target LLMs: \"We red team seven different LLMs... Of these models, Vicuna and Llama-2 are open source, whereas the remaining five are only available as black boxes. These models collectively represent the current state-of-the-art in terms of both generation capability (GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro) and safety alignment (Claude and Llama-2).\"\n\nPage 5, Table III: The table is titled \"Direct jailbreak attacks on JailbreakBench\" and reports the \"Jailbreak %\" for various defended models like Llama-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude-1, Claude-2, and Gemini, demonstrating the method's capability to bypass their safety features."
