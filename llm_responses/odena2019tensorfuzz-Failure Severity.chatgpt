  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper demonstrates that TensorFuzz uncovers robustness and implementation errors (numerical NaNs, model prediction disagreements after quantization, broken loss-function behavior, and unintended semantic changes from code transformations). These are model robustness and software-bug failures rather than violations of safety/policy mechanisms or security-critical behaviors: the authors do not claim discovering jailbreaks, data leakage, bypasses of safety-aligned defenses, or unauthorized actions in defended models. Therefore the failures exposed fit the metric's description of low-severity (robustness/misprediction) failures.",
  "evidence": "Section 6 (Experimental Results): \"TensorFuzz can efficiently find numerical errors in trained neural networks: ... We focus on finding inputs that result in not-a-number (NaN) values.\"; \"TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions: ... the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried.\"; \"TensorFuzz can find real bugs in popular model implementations: ... we hooked up TensorFuzz to the sub-graph defined by the loss function and wrote an objective ... TensorFuzz was able to quickly find a satisfying input.\" (all from Section 6, Experimental Results). Conclusion: \"We have demonstrated the practical utility of TensorFuzz by finding numerical errors, exposing disagreements between neural networks and their quantized versions, surfacing broken loss functions in popular repositories, and making performance improvements to TensorFlow.\" (Conclusion). Nowhere in the paper do the authors claim bypassing explicit safety/policy mechanisms, inducing jailbreaks, data leakage, or other security-critical behaviors (no sections or experiments addressing defended/safety-aligned models or security bypasses)."
