  "why": "The paper proposes PAPILLON, a fuzzing framework where the inputs are text prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). The mutation process uses a helper LLM to generate new jailbreaking prompts (text templates) based on strategies like 'Role-play', 'Contextualization', and 'Expand'. The metric definition explicitly states: 'We also consider fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., synthesized speech, rendered images, or generated text) as reproducible under this metric, since such inputs are inherently stable with respect to standard I/O operations.' Since PAPILLON's mutation operators generate text prompts directly in their final, serialized format, the resulting test cases are not susceptible to alteration or loss of the fault-inducing perturbation through standard I/O operations like rounding or quantization, which typically affect numerical data. The generated text inputs are inherently reproducible, thus meeting the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 4.2, Template Mutation and Optimization: 'PAPILLON uses a LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 turbo), as a mutator to automatically create jailbreaking templates for specific questions.' This is further detailed with descriptions of the mutators: 'Role-play. It involves assigning the LLM a virtual role, such as a writer, screenwriter, gang member, or expert. The LLM is guided by the target question to generate a scenario where the question can be addressed within the scene.' This shows that the mutation process directly yields text, which is an inherently serialized format, ensuring failure reproducibility."
