  "why": "DeepCruiser performs coverage-guided, metamorphic mutation of audio seeds and uses a WER/CER-based oracle to detect inputs whose transcriptions differ from expectations. The framework is designed to find generic mis-transcriptions and to increase coverage of RNN internal states, not to drive the model toward attacker-chosen, specific target outputs or phrases. The mutation, exploration and oracle components all focus on preserving original semantics (metamorphic relations) and flagging deviations (high WER), which corresponds to untargeted exploration that reveals generic faults rather than targeted attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"we propose an automated testing framework, DeepCruiser, which systematically generates tests in large scale to uncover defects of stateful DL systems with coverage guidance.\" (Abstract) \n\nPage 12, Section 6.1 (Metamorphic Transformations): \"To generate suitable defect-triggering candidates, we apply the transformations with restraints to ensure that the audio seeds and the corresponding mutants sound the same to human beings... Transformation operators satisfying the above requirements are said to keep a metamorphic relation...\" (Section 6.1)\n\nPage 13, Section 6.2 (Coverage-Guided Testing / Algorithm 1): \"If the prediction result is inconsistent with the original seed, a' will be added into the failed tests. For audio in ASR, we decide a failed test by checking whether the Word/Character Error Rate (W/CER) exceeds a certain threshold.\" (Section 6.2, Algorithm 1 and explanation)\n\nThese quotes show the approach: (1) mutations are constrained to preserve original semantics (so not crafted to force a particular attacker-chosen output), and (2) the oracle flags transcription differences (WER/CER), indicating untargeted discovery of mis-transcriptions rather than steering to predefined target outputs."
