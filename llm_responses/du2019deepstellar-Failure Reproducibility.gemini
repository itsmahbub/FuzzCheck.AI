  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's coverage-guided testing (CGT) approach relies on metamorphic transformations to generate new test inputs for both image and audio domains. The paper explicitly lists the transformations used: 'image contrast, brightness, translation, scaling, shearing, rotation and add white noise' for images, and 'speed and volume adjustment, low/high-frequency filtering, noise blending' for audio. The metric definition states that applying 'semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization' corresponds to a 'Medium' value. The paper's methodology for test generation (Algorithm 2) and its evaluation do not describe any process of saving and reloading the mutated inputs to account for I/O effects like quantization, clipping, or rounding. The mutations are applied and evaluated on in-memory data representations, without explicit confirmation that the failures would persist after serialization.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5.2: \"For CGT, we mainly focus on image classification and apply the metamorphic mutation strategy [55] for generating new mutants that would keep the prediction meaning from the human's perspective during testing.\"\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, 'Data Preparation': \"For each MNIST model, we also generate 10,000 benign perturbed samples with existing image transformation techniques [50] (i.e., image contrast, brightness, translation, scaling, shearing, rotation and add white noise).\"\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, 'Data Preparation': \"For each ASR model, we generate 10,000 perturbed audios from original benign ones with existing audio data augmentation techniques [5] (i.e., speed and volume adjustment, low/high-frequency filtering, noise blending).\""
