  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzer generates and mutates textual jailbreak templates/prompts (not fine-grained numeric tensor perturbations) and feeds those serialized text prompts to LLMs; the oracle likewise evaluates textual responses. Because inputs are produced directly as text (i.e., already in a serialized format stable to quantization/clipping), the fault-inducing test cases are inherently stable under standard I/O serialization and are not fragile numerical memory artifacts. This matches the metric's allowance that approaches which generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., generated text) are reproducible.",
  "evidence": "Page 4657, Abstract: \"LLM-FUZZER uses human-crafted jailbreak prompts as starting points. By employing carefully customized seed selection strategies and mutation mechanisms, LLM-FUZZER generates additional jailbreak prompts tailored to specific LLMs.\" \n\nPage 4660, Section 3.1 (Proposed Technique / Technical Overview): \"LLM-FUZZER ... begins with a corpus comprising human-written jailbreak templates, serving as the initial seed pool. In each iteration, LLM-FUZZER selects a template from this pool and randomly chooses a mutator to apply the mutation to create a new jailbreak template. Subsequently, it combines this newly generated template with a target question to form a prompt.\" \n\nPage 4662, Section 3.3 (Mutation): \"In this study, we introduce five distinct mutation schemes... Generate: This mutation operator employs an LLM by providing it with a template and instructing the model to generate a new template in a similar style but with different content.... Rephrase: ... instructing the LLM to rephrase every sentence within the template while maintaining the overall meaning.\" \n\nPage 4663, Section 3.4 (Oracle): \"The oracle’s role is to take prompts as input and evaluate the responses to determine if they are harmful. If harmful responses are detected, the oracle assigns a corresponding reward.\" \n\nAppendix D.1 (Mutate Prompt examples): \"I need you to generate one template. I will give you one template example... You are required to write one example with similar style but different content and MUST have '[INSERT PROMPT HERE]' in your template.\""
