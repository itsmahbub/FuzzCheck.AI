  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility in individual mutation steps by using a bounded L2 distance constraint to ensure perturbations are small and imperceptible. The algorithm's design, which uses mutated inputs as new seeds, may overlook the cumulative effect of these small perturbations over many iterations. However, the paper validates the plausibility of the final fault-inducing inputs through manual inspection. The authors state they visually checked all 366 generated adversarial inputs and found them to be imperceptible and nearly identical to the original inputs, which constitutes a form of human-based validation. This combination of bounded per-step constraints and validation of the final outputs, without enforcing plausibility throughout the entire process or using quantitative perceptual metrics, aligns with the 'Medium' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 4, Fuzzing Process: \"Second, DLFuzz adopts l2 distance to measure the perturbation with similar computation with [12]. As for the conditions of seed keeping in line 16, DLFuzz limits our desired distance to a relatively small range (less than 0.02) to ensure the imperceptibility.\"\n\nPage 5, Section 4.3, Discussion: \"Without Manual Effort. For confirmation, we checked all the 366 adversarial inputs generated by DLFuzz, though DLFuzz maintains quite small l2 distance by the restricted threshold. We haven't found any adversarial inputs that have already changed their identities after mutation. The adversarial inputs are nearly the same as the original input, and the perturbations are imperceptible.\""
