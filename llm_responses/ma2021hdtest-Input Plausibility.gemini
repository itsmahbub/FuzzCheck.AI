  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces a form of input plausibility by using a bounded constraint on the perturbations. It explicitly sets an L2 distance threshold and discards any generated images that exceed this limit, with the stated goal of keeping perturbations within an \"invisible\" range. This method constitutes a rule-based constraint on mutations. Furthermore, the paper validates the plausibility of the final generated adversarial inputs by measuring and reporting the normalized L1 and L2 distances from the original inputs, stating that smaller distances are preferred. However, it does not meet the criteria for a \"High\" rating because it does not provide more rigorous empirical evidence of perceptual realism, such as through human studies or by using dedicated perceptual similarity metrics like SSIM or LPIPS. The use of L1/L2 distance serves as a basic validation, fitting the \"Medium\" definition.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section IV, Paragraph 4: 'To ensure the added perturbations are within an \"invisible\" range, we set a threshold for the distance metric during fuzzing (e.g., L2 < 1). When generated images are beyond this limit, it is regarded as unacceptable and then discarded.'\n\nPage 4, Section V.A, Paragraph 1: 'We use different metrics to evaluate HDTest: normalized L1 distance and normalized L2 distance between the mutated image and original image, the average fuzzing iterations and the execution time to successfully generate 1000 adversarial images. A smaller distance between the generated image and the original image is preferred by HDTest because it means less perturbation added to the image.'"
