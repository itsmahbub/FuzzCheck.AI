  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper goes beyond merely reporting discovered regression failures: it analyzes statistical failure patterns (per-class and per-behavior distributions) and links them to underlying vulnerabilities (e.g., overfitting/data bias). It also analyzes model-internal signals (prediction confidences and saliency via Grad-CAM) to explain why different faulty behaviors occur, connecting failures to reliance on different input features. These elements constitute diagnostic analysis that explains why failures occur and relate them to model weaknesses.",
  "evidence": "Page 89, Section IV-B1 (Regression Explication based on DRFuzz): \"From Figure 3(a), we can observe that Classes 7, 8, and 4 contain the most regression faults, which means that the regression process may induce overfitting in these classes. Figure 3(b) shows that inputs of class 1 are wrongly predicted as class 8, inputs of class 9 are wrongly predicted as class 4, and inputs of classes 1, 2, and 9 tend to be predicted as 7 due to the regression process.\" \n\nPage 90, Section V-B (Diversity Analysis): \"To assist the visual analysis, we use the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (heatmap) [61] to visualize the importance of each feature in the prediction process... The important features of Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) for faulty behavior (1 → 8) lie in the center of the images. The important features of Figure 5(c) and Figure 5(d) for faulty behavior (1 → 9) lie on the left of the images. The phenomena above show that different faulty behaviors may be caused by different features...\" \n\nPage 86, Section III-C (Tree-based Seed Pool Trimming): \"we estimate the fault-triggering potential of the seed by the second highest confidence in the prediction vector... If the second highest confidence class in the predication vectors of t1.1 and t2.2 on the regression model is equal to cM2[t3.1], it means that t1.1 and t2.2 are more likely to trigger the same faulty behavior as that triggered by t3.1.\" \n\nPage 84, Section III-A (Diversity Measurement): \"Based on the static initial seeds and the dynamic faulty behaviors for fault-triggering test inputs, DRFuzz adopts the tuple [ta0, (cM1[tai] → cM2[tai])] to approximately distinguish the fault triggering inputs and uses the tuple diversity to represent the diversity of the fault-triggering inputs.\""
