  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides significant diagnostic insight into why jailbreak attacks (failures) succeed by analyzing observable model internals. It establishes a clear correlation between successful attacks and distinct neuron activation patterns. The authors analyze various coverage criteria (NC, TKNC, etc.) across different model layers and blocks to characterize these failures. They explain that jailbreak queries bypass the model's 'safety neurons' and activate different sets of neurons associated with distinct 'knowledge domains' compared to normal or rejected queries. This constitutes a detailed statistical analysis of failure patterns through the lens of model internals (neuron coverage and characteristics), which directly aligns with the definition of the 'Medium' value. The paper does not, however, extend this analysis to link these observable phenomena to underlying root causes of vulnerability like dataset bias or overfitting, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section IV.B, \"Evaluation against Requirement 2\": \"Furthermore, we observe significant coverage differences between normal (SN) and abnormal outputs (SNJ) in well-aligned models. Well-aligned models have safety neurons to reject malicious queries [46], but attack queries often bypass these and activate neurons linked to abnormal behaviors. As a result, normal and abnormal behaviors activate different neurons, causing coverage differences. ... This may be because LLMs associate specific neurons with different knowledge domains [20], [47], leading to varying activation patterns depending on the query type. Abnormal behaviors, such as bias or harmful content, activate distinct knowledge areas, triggering neurons linked to negative or harmful knowledge domains, which results in noticeable activation differences.\""
