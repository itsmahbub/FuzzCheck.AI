  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper applies metamorphic transformations to in-memory floating-point image tensors and enforces semantic equivalence via manually tuned parameter domains and an SSIM threshold, but it does not account for standard I/O serialization effects (e.g., 8-bit quantization, rounding, clipping, or image encoding) when generating or validating test inputs. The only quantization discussed in the paper concerns model weight quantization (32-bit to 16-bit) used for a differential oracle, not input serialization. Because the method neither constrains mutations to survive common serialization nor evaluates reproducibility after saving/encoding, fault-inducing perturbations could be lost after standard I/O operations; this matches the metric definition for \"Low.\"",
  "evidence": "Page 455, IV.A Metamorphic Transformation: \"To infer the valid domain interval of each transformation’s parameters, we manually tune them to set up the appropriate range of values, i.e., high and low boundaries, that preserves the input semantics before and after each transformation, with respect to the data distribution.\" \n\nPage 455, IV.A Metamorphic Transformation: \"To verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original inputs, we compute a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [8] ... Therefore, we reject mutated synthetic inputs for which SSIM values are lower than a tuned threshold.\" \n\nPage 457, V.D RQ3: \"TensorFuzz [5] performs a coverage-guided fuzzing process to generate mutated inputs that are able to expose disagreements between a DNN trained on MNIST (that is 32-bit floating point precision) and its quantized versions where all weights are truncated to 16-bit floating points.\""
