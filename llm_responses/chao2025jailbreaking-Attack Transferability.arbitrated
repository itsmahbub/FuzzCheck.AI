  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper clearly demonstrates reuse of fault-inducing inputs (jailbreak prompts) generated on one model to test their effectiveness on other models (see Section IV-B, Table VI). However, while the authors attribute high transferability to the semantic, interpretable nature of PAIR’s prompt-level attacks, the core design of PAIR is focused on efficiently generating jailbreaks on a single target model rather than explicitly optimizing for cross-model transfer. Thus it meets the criteria for Medium: it reuses inputs for transfer tests but does not incorporate mechanisms explicitly aimed at discovering transferable failures.",
  "evidence": "Section IV-B (p. 28): “For PAIR, we use the successful jailbreaks found for GPT-4 and Vicuna… Our results in Table VI indicate that PAIR’s Vicuna prompts transfer more readily than those generated by GCG… We believe that this is largely attributable to the fact that PAIR’s prompts are semantic, and they therefore target similar vulnerabilities across LLMs.”; Table VI caption: “Jailbreak transferability. We report the jailbreaking percentage of prompts that successfully jailbreak a source LLM when transferred to downstream LLM.”"
