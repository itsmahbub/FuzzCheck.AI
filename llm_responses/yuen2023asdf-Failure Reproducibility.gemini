  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's method, ASDF, generates test inputs by synthesizing audio directly from text using a Text-To-Speech (TTS) service. This process creates inputs in a standard, serialized audio format. The metric definition explicitly states that approaches generating inputs 'directly in serialized formats (e.g., synthesized speech...)' are considered reproducible and meet the 'High' criteria. The mutations in ASDF are performed at the text level (e.g., changing tense, substituting homophones) before the audio is ever generated. This means the fault-inducing properties are embedded in the content of the speech itself, not as fragile numerical perturbations to an audio waveform that could be lost during I/O operations like quantization or rounding. The generated audio file is inherently stable, ensuring that any failure it induces is reproducible.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section III. CORE FUNCTIONALITIES: 'The input text corpus should be in the format of a .txt file. Each line of text in the file is converted into an audio file by gTTS [18].'\n\nPage 1, Section I. INTRODUCTION: 'After collecting a small initial set of failed test cases, ASDF transforms the failed texts using various text transformation methods to further generate more test cases. For example, changing the tense of a sentence or substituting error-inducing terms with other words that have similar phonemes.'\n\nPage 1, Section II. TOOL DESIGN: 'A Text-To-Speech (TTS) service is used to generate audio from the text, which is then fed into the ASR systems to obtain their transcriptions.'"
