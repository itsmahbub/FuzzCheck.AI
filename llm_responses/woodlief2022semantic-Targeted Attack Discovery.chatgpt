  "why": "The paper describes semSensFuzz / semImFuzz as a semantic, but non-guided, mutation-based fuzzer that generates varied inputs (e.g., add car, add person, recolor) and measures drops in pixel-level IoU to reveal inconsistencies. It uses random test/resource selection and does not implement or claim any mechanism to steer generation toward attacker-chosen specific outputs or target labels/phrases. The authors explicitly describe the approach as non-guided and state that guiding mutations by SUT performance (which could enable targeted discovery) is future work. Therefore the method performs untargeted exploration that discovers generic failures (misclassifications/inconsistencies), not targeted attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 1959, Introduction: \"This paper takes the first step towards our long-term vision by proposing and evaluating an approach for non-guided test generation that can, for example, incorporate vehicles and people into images.\" (Section 1, para 3).\nPage 1966, Evaluation / RQ1 Results: \"Since semImFuzz uses random test and resource selection, we computed the number of duplicate tests generated as an indication of saturation.\" (Section 6.4.1, para 3) — showing random/untargeted selection.\nPage 1968, Conclusion and Future Work: \"Following standard software fuzzing, we will examine how to use SUT performance to guide mutation type and parameter selection to more quickly find inconsistencies.\" (Section 7) — indicating guided/targeted steering is not part of the current implementation but planned future work."
