  "why": "The paper's method, BET, is explicitly designed and evaluated for a differential testing (DT) scenario, which aligns with the concept of attack transferability. The fuzzing design incorporates an explicit mechanism—a tunable objective function for DT—specifically to discover transferable failures by maximizing the prediction differences between a target model and other related models. The evaluation section is dedicated to demonstrating this capability, where generated inputs are systematically tested against pairs of models (an original and its quantized version) to find disagreements, which are a form of transferable failure.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.3, \"Tunable objective function for DT\": \"For DT, we hope to identify inputs that can maximize the prediction difference between the target model with other models... The tunable objective function for DT is defined in Equation 5... The second term Σ|C(x)[lo] – Ĉi(x)[lo]| aims to find disagreements between the target model C with a batch of other models Ĉ = {C1, C2, ...Ĉn}, as such disagreements indicate error-inducing inputs are found.\"\n\nPage 8, Section 4.2, \"Evaluation of Black-Box Differential Testing\": \"Constructing differential models. To get a convincing DT result, we directly use Tensorflow-Lite... to construct quantized models for DT... Then, we try to generate error-inducing inputs that cause disagreements between the original model with its quantized models. e.g., generating error-inducing inputs between ResNet50 with ResNet50-q8.\""
