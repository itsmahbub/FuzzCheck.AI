  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper uses semantic-preserving, metamorphic image transformations (rotation, translation, shear, zoom, brightness, contrast) as mutation operators and generates augmented inputs on-the-fly during training. These coarse transformations are inherently less sensitive to tiny floating‑point memory artifacts, but the paper does not explicitly address standard I/O serialization effects (quantization, rounding, clipping) nor does it claim to constrain mutations so that perturbations survive common image serialization. It therefore aligns with the metric’s description of “considering serialization effects partially (e.g., applying metamorphic transformations) but without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization,” i.e., Medium.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.2 (Generation of Realistic Variations), p.1153: \"The operations and corresponding restrictions with respect to an image x are as follows: • rotation(x,d): rotate x by d degree within a range [-30, 30]. • translation(x, d): horizontally or vertically translate x by d pixels within a range of [-10%, 10%] of image size. • shear(x,d): ... • brightness(x,d): uniformly add or subtract a value d for each pixel of x within a range of [-32, 32] • contrast(x,d): scale the RGB value of each pixel of x by a factor d within range of [0.8, 1.2]\"; Section 3.3.2 (Generation of population), p.1150: \"...Sensei always applies the resulting transformation vector (chromosome) on the original image (as opposed to applying on an already transformed data) to prevent the resulting data from being unrealistic.\"; Section 5.1 (Implementation), p.1153: \"we implement a new data generator that augments the training data during training. Our data generator takes as inputs the current model and original training set, augments the original data and then feeds the augmented data to the training process at each step.\" These passages show the use of metamorphic (coarse) image transformations applied in-memory during training but no explicit handling or discussion of serialization/quantization/clipping to ensure failures persist after saving to standard image formats."
