  "why": "The paper demonstrates that DeepXplore uncovers failures that go beyond simple model robustness errors and directly violate user and safety expectations by producing unsafe or security-compromising outputs. Specifically, the authors show that their method can generate inputs causing a self-driving car model to make decisions that lead to a crash, and cause malware detection models to misclassify malicious software as benign. These represent clear violations of safety and security expectations. However, the paper does not provide evidence of bypassing explicit, engineered safety or security mechanisms in defended or safety-aligned models (e.g., adversarially trained models, or models with safety filters), which is a requirement for the 'High' rating. The failures are exposed in standard, state-of-the-art models of the time, not models with specific defenses.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Abstract: \"DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models...\"\n\nPage 3, Figure 1 Caption: \"An example erroneous behavior found by DeepXplore in Nvidia DAVE-2 self-driving car platform. The DNN-based self-driving car correctly decides to turn left for image (a) but incorrectly decides to turn right and crashes into the guardrail for image (b), a slightly darker version of (a).\"\n\nPage 9, Section 6.1, Test datasets and DNNs: The evaluation is performed on datasets with clear safety and security implications, including the 'Driving' dataset from Udacity's self-driving car challenge, the 'Contagio/VirusTotal' PDF malware dataset, and the 'Drebin' Android malware dataset."
