  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "QATest generates test inputs via semantic, metamorphic text transformations (MR1–MR3) and uses text-based quality checks (ROUGE, perplexity) but does not explicitly account for standard I/O serialization effects (e.g., quantization, clipping, or encoding-induced loss) or enforce that failures persist across serialization. The method therefore relies on semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations (which the metric treats as providing only partial enforcement of reproducibility) without explicit handling of serialization effects, matching the metric's \"Medium\" category.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 Test Generation with MRs (page 3–4): \"we implement three textual semantically consistent transformations, i.e., grammatical component-based, sentence structure-based, and adversarial perturbation-based transformations.\" \n\nSection 3.2.1 Test Oracle (page 4): \"Metamorphic Relations (MRs) ... We define a series of semantically consistent transformations T for questions q ∈ Q. The generated question q' can be obtained by applying the transformation t ∈ T to the original question q, and q' has the same intent and meaning as q. Therefore, the QA system should output the same answer for the q and q'.\" \n\nSection 3.2.5 Quality Assessment (page 5): \"To ensure the quality of generated questions, we employ the ROUGE-1 metric [35] to evaluate the questions generated by metamorphic transformations.\" \n\nSection 4.3 Sentence Transformations (page 7): \"Most of the transformations are implemented with a tool named nlpaug... We employ the WordNet library... BERT... TagMe...\" \n\n(Throughout the paper there is no mention of explicit handling of I/O serialization effects such as quantization, clipping, or re-encoding to verify that failures persist after standard serialization.)"
