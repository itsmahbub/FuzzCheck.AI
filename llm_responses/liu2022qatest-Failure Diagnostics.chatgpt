  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper goes beyond merely reporting discovered failures: it provides statistical analyses of failure patterns (counts, failure rates, diversity metrics across datasets and systems, and iteration effects) and presents a case study that classifies common error types found (five representative bug types). However, it does not analyze observable model internals (neuron activations, layer coverage, or similar signals) nor does it empirically link failures to underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting. These characteristics match the metric's \"Medium\" level (statistical failure-pattern analysis and diagnostic insight) rather than \"High\" (which requires linking failures to underlying model vulnerabilities via internals or stronger evidence).",
  "evidence": "p.8, Section 5.1 (Metamorphic Transformations): \"For all QA systems, applying the three types of MR alone can generate more failed tests than the original test set, which indicates that each type of MR has the ability to reveal erroneous behaviors and discover more potential flaws in QA systems than the original test set.\" \n\np.8, Section 5.2 (Answer to RQ2: Guidance Criteria): \"the test sets generated using the two testing criteria as guidance can generate more failed tests and achieve higher bug detection rates than those generated without guidance.\" (Table 4 shows counts and proportions of failed tests under different guidance strategies.)\n\np.9, Section 5.3 (Answer to RQ3: Test Diversity): \"we count the number of different original seed data corresponding to the failed tests generated by each method... To reflect the diversity of bug categories, we calculate the ratio of the number of seeds that can trigger bugs to the total number, which is expressed as diversity.\" (Table 5 reports these diversity metrics across systems/datasets.)\n\np.10, Section 5.4 (Answer to RQ4: Case Study): \"we show five types of representative erroneous behaviors... (1) <NoAnswer> questions are answered with irrelevant content... (2) Answerable questions are answered with <NoAnswer>... (3) Answers that are unrelated to the question... (4) Answers with wrong keywords in the context... (5) Answers without logical reasoning.\" (Table 6 gives concrete examples for these types.)"
