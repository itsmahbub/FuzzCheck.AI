  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper enforces perceptual plausibility throughout the fuzzing process by measuring and bounding the L2 distance of each mutated input relative to the original input (used as a criterion before keeping a seed), thereby preventing cumulative drift across iterations. In addition, the authors report an explicit manual validation of all generated adversarial inputs (366 images) and state they found no changes of identity and that perturbations are imperceptible. These constitute an enforcement mechanism plus empirical human validation that final fault-inducing inputs remain perceptually realistic.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 (Algorithm) — (page 741): Algorithm 1, line 15: \"l2_distance = distance(x', x) //measure the perturbation\" and accompanying text: \"As for the conditions of seed keeping in line 16, DLFuzz limits our desired distance to a relatively small range (less than 0.02) to ensure the imperceptibility.\" \n\nSection 3.1 (Architecture) — (page 740): \"The minute perturbation is restricted to be invisible and ensures the prediction results before and after the mutation to be the same.\" \n\nSection 4.3 (Discussion) — (page 742): \"For confirmation, we checked all the 366 adversarial inputs generated by DLFuzz, though DLFuzz maintains quite small l2 distance by the restricted threshold. We haven't found any adversarial inputs that have already changed their identities after mutation. The adversarial inputs are nearly the same as the original input, and the perturbations are imperceptible.\""
