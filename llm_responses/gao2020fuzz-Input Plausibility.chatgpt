  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility through bounded, rule-based constraints on allowed transformations and by design prevents cumulative drift (it always applies each mutation to the original seed). These measures ensure mutated inputs remain realistic by construction during the iterative search. However, the paper does not provide empirical perceptual or semantic plausibility assessments (no human study or task-specific perceptual metrics such as LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity) for the final fault-inducing / augmented inputs, so it does not meet the 'High' requirement of providing empirical evidence that final inputs remain perceptually realistic.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.3.2 (Generation of population), p.1150: \"once a new chromosome is generated through the mutation or crossover, it is validated to make sure that it is within the range of each transformation that we set globally (line 12). Furthermore, Sensei always applies the resulting transformation vector (chromosome) on the original image (as opposed to applying on an already transformed data) to prevent the resulting data from being unrealistic.\"; Section 4.2 (Generation of Realistic Variations), p.1153: \"To make sure the translated images are visually similar to natural ones, we restrict the space of allowed perturbations following [8] where it is applicable. The operations and corresponding restrictions ... rotation(x,d): rotate x by d degree within a range [-30, 30]. translation(x, d): ... within a range of [-10%, 10%] ... brightness(x,d): ... range of [-32, 32] ... contrast(x,d): ... range of [0.8, 1.2].\"; Section 4.3 (Evaluation Metric), p.1153: \"robust accuracy is the proportion of images in the testing dataset where the prediction of a DNN does not fluctuate with any small realistic perturbations...\" — the paper's evaluation uses robust accuracy as the reported metric and does not report any human evaluation or perceptual-similarity scores (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM) for the generated/augmented images."
