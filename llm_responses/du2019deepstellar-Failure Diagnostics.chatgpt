  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight into failures by analyzing observable model internals and statistical failure patterns. It (1) constructs an abstract state-transition (DTMC) model of RNN internals, (2) defines trace-similarity metrics and multiple state/transition coverage criteria over that model, and (3) performs statistical analyses that correlate these internal signals with prediction differences and adversarial behavior (e.g., significant Spearman / Mann-Whitney results, coverage increases for adversarial samples, and observations that rarely-visited states/transitions are exercised by adversarial inputs). However, the paper stops short of linking discovered failures to deeper causes such as reliance on specific non-robust/spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting; therefore it does not meet the “High” bar but clearly exceeds “Low.”",
  "evidence": "Page 479, Section 3.3 (Trace Similarity Metrics): \"The trace similarity metrics range over [0, 1], where 0 indicates disjoint sets (i.e., traces induced by x and y are totally different), while 1 indicating equal sets (i.e., the traces are similar).\"  \n\nPage 480, Section 4 (Coverage Criteria for RNN): \"The goal of the RNN coverage criteria is to measure the sufficiency of test data in exercising the trained as well as the unseen behaviors.\"  \n\nPage 484, Section 6.2 (RQ1: Trace Similarity): \"We perform a statistical analysis on the correlation between the trace similarity and the prediction difference over the slightly perturbed samples and their original benign samples.... All reported correlations are statistically significant (with p << 0.01). Negative association of Spearman correlation indicates that the larger the similarity metrics, the less different the predicted transcripts would be.\"  \n\nPage 484, Section 6.3 (RQ2: Coverage Criteria): \"We observed that finer-grained abstract models tend to have larger coverage increase ratio.... WSCov’/WTCov’ is larger, with a competitive performance as BSCov and BTCov, indicating rarely visited states and transitions tend to be covered by adversarial/perturbed samples.\"  \n\nPage 477 (intro/overview), Abstract/Intro summary: \"(2) the coverage criteria are useful in revealing erroneous behaviors (generating three times more adversarial samples than random testing and hundreds times more than the unrolling approach).\""
