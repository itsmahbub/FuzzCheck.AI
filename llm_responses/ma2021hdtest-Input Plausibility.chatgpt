  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility constraints during fuzzing (they set an explicit distance threshold to keep perturbations “invisible” and discard candidates beyond it) and reports quantitative distance metrics (normalized L1/L2) and sample images for the final adversarial inputs. However, the paper does not perform stronger perceptual/semantic evaluations (no human study, no task-specific perceptual metrics such as LPIPS/SSIM) nor does it explicitly analyze cumulative drift across multiple mutation iterations beyond the single distance threshold. This matches the \"Medium\" description: plausibility is enforced/validated (bounded constraints and final-distance reporting) but cumulative-effects and perceptual validation are not thoroughly addressed.",
  "evidence": "Section IV. HDTest Framework (page ~393-394): \"To ensure the added perturbations are within an 'invisible' range, we set a threshold for the distance metric during fuzzing (e.g., L2 < 1). When generated images are beyond this limit, it is regarded as unacceptable and then discarded.\" \n\nSection V.A Experimental Setup (page ~394): \"We use different metrics to evaluate HDTest: normalized L1 distance and normalized L2 distance between the mutated image and original image, the average fuzzing iterations and the execution time to successfully generate 1000 adversarial images.\" \n\nSection V.B Mutation Strategies Analysis (page ~394-395): \"We provide sample original images, mutated pixels, and generated images of HDTest in Fig. 4–6, under gauss, rand, and shift respectively.\" \n\n(Absence of stronger perceptual/semantic evaluation): Nowhere in the paper do the authors report human evaluation or task-specific perceptual metrics (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS, PESQ, STOI, Perplexity) for the final fault-inducing inputs; their evaluation is limited to L1/L2 distances, iteration counts, runtime, and example figures."
