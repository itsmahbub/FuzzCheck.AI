  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs its metamorphic mutation strategy to maintain the semantic validity of generated inputs throughout the fuzzing process, directly addressing the issue of cumulative transformations leading to implausible results. The methodology enforces this by allowing structural changes (Affine Transformations) only once per mutation sequence from an initial seed, while constraining subsequent pixel-level changes relative to a stable reference image. This design directly counters the problem of input drift over multiple iterations. Furthermore, the paper provides strong empirical evidence for the plausibility of its generated inputs via a formal user study. The study assessed the validity of thousands of generated images and found that DeepHunter's strategy produces a very low percentage of invalid images (e.g., 0.8% for ImageNet, 1.2% for MNIST), thus confirming that the inputs it generates, including those that find faults, remain perceptually realistic.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.2.3, Definition 5 and surrounding text: 'In order to keep the semantics of the mutants close to the original seed, we adopt a conservative strategy that selects the Affine Transformation to be used only once (we assume that mutation with only one affine transformation will not affect the semantics with the carefully selected parameters) as an image is more likely to be unrecognizable if it is changed by multiple affine transformations.' This describes the mechanism for controlling cumulative effects. \n\nPage 7, Section 4, 'User Study Settings': 'For RQ1, we perform the user study on 3 different strategies that constrain the generation of test images, and evaluate their effectiveness in generating valid test images... Each participant is asked to perform manual analysis on each of the generated test images in line with its original counterpart. A generated image is marked invalid if it either could not be perceived, or is recognized as a different class compared with its original counterpart.' This describes the empirical evaluation. \n\nPage 8, Table 2: This table presents the results of the user study, showing that DeepHunter generated invalid images at rates of only 1.2% (MNIST), 2.9% (CIFAR-10), and 0.8% (ImageNet), providing quantitative evidence of plausibility."
