  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly recognizes that cumulative perturbations across multiple fuzzing iterations can lead to unrealistic inputs, a key concern for maintaining plausibility. To address this, the authors propose a strategy that goes beyond simple, single-step constraints. Their method, DeepCruiser, enforces plausibility throughout the fuzzing process by (1) carefully parameterizing individual audio transformations to ensure the output remains realistic and intelligible to humans, and (2) implementing a strong constraint that prevents the accumulation of different types of semantic-altering transformations. Specifically, a seed audio can be mutated by altering its volume, speed, or clearness characteristics at most once. This rule is designed to prevent the 'accumulated distortions' that could push an input outside the plausible distribution, thus ensuring that generated test cases remain realistic within the speech recognition domain.",
  "evidence": "Page 13-14, Section 6.1: The paper first acknowledges the problem of cumulative effects: 'However, when an audio input a0 is processed with a sequence of transformations (e.g., a0 -> a1,..., -> ai), there is a higher chance that the audio cannot be well recognized by human due to accumulated distortions.' It then proposes a specific strategy to prevent this: '(1) we carefully set the parameters to ensure that a single step transformation... does not violate the metamorphic relations (i.e., human hearing are not affected); and (2) an audio, generated by mutating from a seed after a sequence of transformations T, is limited to be mutated by a transformation t ∈ S ∪ UAT such that ({t} ∪ S) ∩ T = ∅, where S ∈ {VR, SRT, CRT}. Intuitively, the constraints make sure that a mutant is generated by altering the volume, speed or clearness of a seed input at most once.'"
