  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's methodology and evaluation focus on generating test cases to find defects within a single Deep Neural Network (DNN) model or between a model and its own quantized version. The experiments are conducted on two distinct models, LeNet and CifarNet, but they are used for different datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively) and are treated as separate, independent evaluation subjects. The paper does not describe any experiment or methodology where fault-inducing inputs generated for one model are subsequently used to test a different model performing the same task. Therefore, the concept of attack transferability is not assessed.",
  "evidence": "Page 456, Section V, EMPIRICAL EVALUATION: The research questions guiding the evaluation are: \"RQ1: How much can DeepEvolution increase the coverage of generated test cases? RQ2: Can DeepEvolution detect diverse erroneous behaviors in DNN models? RQ3: Can DeepEvolution detect divergences induced by DNN quantization?\". All three questions are focused on the behavior of a single model under test. \n\nPage 456, Section V.A, Experiment Setup: \"DNNs. For each dataset (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we took, respectively, the official open-source implementation of Tensorflow models, LeNet [3] and CifarNet [4] to allow the reproducibility of our results and comparisons with our approach.\" This shows that the experiments test one specific model per dataset, rather than testing multiple models on a single dataset to check for transferability.\n\nPage 457, Section V.D, RQ3: DNN Quantization Defects: The evaluation for quantization defects involves comparing a model to its own modified version, not to a different model. \"TensorFuzz [5] performs a coverage-guided fuzzing process to generate mutated inputs that are able to expose disagreements between a DNN trained on MNIST (that is 32-bit floating point precision) and its quantized versions...\" This further illustrates that the testing scope is limited to a single model architecture at a time."
