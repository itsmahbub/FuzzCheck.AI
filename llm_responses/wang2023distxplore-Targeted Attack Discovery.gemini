  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's proposed method, DistXplore, is explicitly designed for targeted attack discovery. The core mechanism involves selecting a source class and a predefined target class. The fuzzer's objective is to generate test cases from the source class that are statistically similar to the training data of the chosen target class. This is achieved by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the generated test suite and the training data of the target class. This design directly steers the exploration toward inducing the model to misclassify an input into a specific, attacker-chosen output class, which aligns perfectly with the 'High' rating for this metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.1.1, Model Evaluation: \"Thus, DistXplore aims to generate test cases (in a class) that are statistically similar to the training data in other classes. Formally, given a DNN f and a test suite Sc belonging to a source class c, we define its distribution difference with respect to the training data (Tc') in another target class c' as: DFf(Sc, c') = MMD(fi(Sc), fi(Tc')) where fi refers to the output of the layer l and c' ≠ c.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 3.2, Distribution-Guided Test Generation: \"The objective function can be defined as DFf(Sc, c') ≈ v... where Sc is the test suite belonging to c, c' is a target class... For the goal of model evaluation, v is set as 0, i.e., to generate Sc that is statistically indistinguishable from the training data in c'.\"\n\nPage 6, Algorithm 1: The algorithm's inputs are listed as: \"Input: f: the target DNN, Sc: a seed test suite from class c, c': the target class, v: target distribution difference\"."
