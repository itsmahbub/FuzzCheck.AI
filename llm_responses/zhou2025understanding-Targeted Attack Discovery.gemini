  "why": "The paper's method supports the discovery of a broad class of security-violating behaviors, specifically 'jailbreak attacks,' which cause the model to generate harmful or malicious content. The exploration is guided by coverage criteria to find inputs that trigger this general category of failure (i.e., bypassing safety measures). It does not, however, steer the exploration toward generating a specific, predefined target output (e.g., a particular harmful sentence), which would be required for a 'High' rating. The goal is to induce any successful jailbreak, which is a class of unsafe behavior, rather than performing untargeted exploration for generic faults.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section V, Application: The paper describes three applications of its findings, all centered around jailbreaks. One application is 'Jailbreak Case Generation,' where the stated goal is to use coverage to 'guide the creation of attack examples' and 'refine prompts to generate adversarial examples.' The evaluation of this method counts the 'Number of Successful Jailbreak Queries' (Figure 6), confirming the target is the class of 'successful jailbreak' behavior, not a specific output string. The text states: 'By utilizing coverage to guide the creation of attack examples, Jailbreak Case Generation method identifies areas of the model that remain unexplored. Iterative refinement of prompts based on coverage gains ensures that the generated cases are effective in exposing vulnerabilities...'"
