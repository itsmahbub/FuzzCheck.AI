  "why": "The paper's testing framework mutates audio waveforms in memory using metamorphic transformations and evaluates failures via WER, but it does not describe any explicit handling of standard I/O serialization effects (e.g., quantization, clipping, rounding when saving to common audio/image formats) nor does it constrain mutations to ensure perturbations persist after serialization. The methodology and oracle (WER) operate on generated audio without mention of writing/reading through typical storage formats or accounting for their numeric effects. The authors also discuss using conservative metamorphic parameters and manual checking to avoid false positives, which indicates they did not incorporate explicit automated serialization-aware measures into generation or oracle evaluation.",
  "evidence": "Section 6.1 \"Metamorphic Transformations of Audio Signals\" (page 12-13): \"To generate suitable defect-triggering candidates, we apply the transformations with restraints to ensure that the audio seeds and the corresponding mutants sound the same to human beings... we carefully set the parameters to ensure that a single step transformation (on volume, speed or clearness) does not violate the metamorphic relations... the audio will not be transformed further.\"; Section 6.2 Algorithm 1 (page 14): shows mutation and prediction steps (a' = mutate(t,a); cov, result <- Predict(R,a')) but contains no steps for serialization or handling quantization/clipping; Section 7.6 \"Threats to Validity\" (page 19): \"We adopt a conservative metamorphic transformation strategy to make small changes on the original audio such that DeepCruiser will generate realistic audio. However, it may still cause false positives... To mitigate this problem, we manually check...\" — no mention of accounting for I/O serialization effects (quantization/clipping) during test generation or oracle evaluation."
