  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly constrains the mutation space to realistic, label-preserving image transformations with fixed global parameter ranges and validates each generated chromosome against those ranges. Crucially, Sensei applies every candidate transformation vector to the original seed image (not to an already-transformed image), which prevents accumulation of perturbations across iterations. These design choices enforce input plausibility throughout the iterative genetic-search/fuzzing process, keeping mutated inputs within a plausible input distribution.",
  "evidence": "Page 1150, Section 3.3.2 (Generation of population): \"It should be noted that once a new chromosome is generated through the mutation or crossover, it is validated to make sure that it is within the range of each transformation that we set globally (line 12). Furthermore, Sensei always applies the resulting transformation vector (chromosome) on the original image (as opposed to applying on an already transformed data) to prevent the resulting data from being unrealistic.\" \n\nPage 1150, Algorithm 3 (Generation of population), line 12: \"if isValid(x1) then children = children ∪ x1\" (shows explicit validation of generated candidates). \n\nPage 1153, Section 4.2 (Generation of Realistic Variations): \"To make sure the translated images are visually similar to natural ones, we restrict the space of allowed perturbations following [8] where it is applicable. The operations and corresponding restrictions with respect to an image x are as follows: rotation(x,d): rotate x by d degree within a range [-30, 30]. translation(x, d): ... within a range of [-10%, 10%] ... shear(x,d): ... range of [-0.1, 0.1]. zoom(x,d): zoom in/out x with a zoom factor d ranging [0.9,1.1] brightness(x,d): ... within a range of [-32, 32] contrast(x,d): ... within range of [0.8, 1.2]\""
