  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight into why failures occur by analyzing observable model internals (logits-layer activations) via distribution-distance (MMD) and by reporting statistical failure patterns (e.g., Error Rate, Error_target Rate, detection rates versus MMD). DistXplore measures MMD on the model's logits, tracks how MMD_target decreases while error rates and detection-avoidance increase, and uses class-level distribution comparisons and distribution-diversity analyses (RQ3/RQ4) to connect discovered failures to distribution shift vulnerabilities. However, the paper does not provide deeper causal analysis tying failures to specific spurious/non-robust features, neuron-level characteristics (beyond using the logits layer), or detailed per-neuron activation analyses, so it does not meet the bar for \"High.\"",
  "evidence": "Page 71, Section 3.1.1 (Model Evaluation): \"Formally, given a DNN F and a test suite S belonging to a source class c, we define its distribution difference with respect to the training data (D_{T_{c'}}) in another target class c' as: DF(S, c') = MMD(f_c(S), f_{c'}(T_{c'})) ... The distribution difference is measured on a specific layer of the DNN. In this paper, we select the logits layer, i.e., the layer before the softmax layer, which is frequently used in previous works ... Intuitively, the smaller the value DF(S, c'), the more difficult it is for the model F to distinguish S and T_{c'}. Hence, it is more likely to generate undetectable errors by minimizing their distribution difference.\" (Section 3.1.1, p.71)\n\nPage 75, Section 4.2.1 (RQ1 results / optimization behavior): \"The results show that, during the optimization, the distribution of S is getting closer to the training distribution of the target class (see MMD_target) and getting farther away from the source class (see MMD_source). Meanwhile, Error Rate and Error_target Rate are increasing, indicating that more errors are generated and gradually become statistically indistinguishable between the original class c and target class c'. The effect of indistinguishability can be further confirmed by the detection results (i.e., Dissector and A2D): errors become indistinguishable and difficult to detect while the MMD_target decreases.\" (Section 4.2.1, p.75)\n\nPage 70, Section 2.1.4 (MMD definition / internals used): \"To measure the distribution difference, we adopt the metric Maximum Mean Discrepancy ... The empirical estimation of MMD between the two distributions in RKHS, denoted as MMD(X,Y), can be calculated as: ...\" (Section 2.1.4, p.70)\n\nPage 76, Section 4.2.4 (RQ4 / statistical analysis of distribution diversity): \"Compared to the results DistXplore, we found that the accuracy drops if only considering the distribution difference diversity (DistXplore^{df}) or target diversity (DistXplore^{tc}), which indicates the usefulness of both kinds of diversity in improving the robustness.\" (Section 4.2.4, p.76)\n\nAdditional supporting material: the paper repeatedly links failures to distribution shift and training-vs-real-world distribution differences (e.g., Introduction and Sec.2.1.3), and evaluates detection rates (Table 1) and statistical metrics (Error Rate / Error_target Rate) across iterations to explain why failures are hard to detect (pp.69-76)."
