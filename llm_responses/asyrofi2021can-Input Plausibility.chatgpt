  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility via a rule-based cross-referencing filter: synthesized audio-text pairs are accepted as valid only if at least one ASR correctly transcribes them, which ensures generated inputs are intelligible/valid at the time of creation. However, the paper does not provide any human evaluation or task-specific perceptual/semantic quality metrics (e.g., PESQ, STOI, LPIPS, SSIM, Perplexity) for the final fault-inducing inputs, nor does it report additional quantitative checks of perceptual realism. Also, although their cross-referencing filter enforces plausibility per generated audio, the work does not report explicit mechanisms or analyses addressing cumulative mutations or perceptual assessment of final failing inputs. These facts align with the \"Medium\" level: plausibility is enforced by rule-based constraints but there is no empirical perceptual validation of final fault-triggering inputs.",
  "evidence": "Section II.A (p.675): \"to avoid using the invalid audios synthesized by the TTS system, the generated audio-text pair is fed into multiple ASR systems for cross-referencing: If at least one ASR system can successfully transcribe the audio, the audio-text pair is viewed as a valid test case.\"; Section II.A (p.675): \"We take the audio-text pair as an indeterminable test case if none of them can successfully transcribe the audio.\"; Section III.B (p.676): \"The TTS system is ResponsiveVoice. The 5 ASR systems are DeepSpeech, DeepSpeech2, Wav2Letter++, Wav2Vec2, and Wit.\"; Section III.C (p.676): \"We use two metrics to evaluate the performance of the SUT. One is the number of failed test cases uncovered by CrossASR++, and the other is the word error rate (WER) on a test set.\". The paper contains no reported human study or perceptual/quality measures (e.g., PESQ, STOI, LPIPS, SSIM, Perplexity) for assessing realism of final fault-inducing inputs."
