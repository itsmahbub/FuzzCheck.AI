  "value": "Low",
  "why": "Although the paper uses model‐internal signals (loss, neuron coverage) to guide its genetic search and selective augmentation, it does not perform any post‐hoc analysis of the failures it discovers to explain their root causes or to link them to broader model vulnerabilities (e.g., spurious features, dataset bias, overfitting). All evaluation is framed in terms of aggregate ‘robust accuracy’ improvements, and while the paper reports that loss‐based selection is more conservative than classification‐based selection (Table 7), it never examines the patterns or origins of the underlying failures themselves. There is no statistical breakdown of failure modes by class or transformation, nor any analysis of internal neuron activations or feature attributions to diagnose why the model fails under specific perturbations.",
  "evidence": "The entire experimental evaluation (Section 5) centers on measuring and improving ‘robust accuracy’ (Equation 6, Table 2) via augmentation, with no subsequent analysis of the discovered failures. For example, Table 7 (p. 1156) compares loss‐based versus classification‐based selection purely in terms of robust accuracy gains, not as a diagnostic of failure causes."
