  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility to a limited extent by using a bounded perturbation constraint. Specifically, it uses the L∞ norm to restrict the magnitude of modifications applied to the original input images. This is a common technique to ensure the perturbed image does not deviate excessively from the original, thereby acting as a proxy for plausibility. However, the paper does not provide any empirical validation to confirm that the resulting error-inducing inputs are perceptually or semantically realistic. There is no mention of human studies or quantitative, task-specific metrics like SSIM or LPIPS to assess the visual quality of the generated inputs. The evaluation focuses exclusively on the number and diversity of errors found. Therefore, the method meets the criteria for \"Medium\" as it enforces plausibility through a bounded constraint but does not empirically validate the plausibility of the final outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.1 Experimental Setup, subsection Hyperparameters: \"We use the widely used L∞ metric [4] to restrict perturbations for error-inducing inputs on all compared methods. To set values of L∞, we first run all compared methods under different L∞ for multiple times, and then we choose values that make them perform relatively well, i.e., L∞ = 13/255 on all datasets (all compared methods use the same setting).\""
