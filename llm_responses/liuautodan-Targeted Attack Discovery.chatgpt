  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly defines and optimizes for attacker-chosen target outputs (affirmative answers beginning with a fixed prefix) and uses a fitness function that maximizes the conditional probability of those target tokens. AutoDAN's genetic search (including termination based on refusal-keyword checks) is driven to produce prompts that cause the model to emit a specific target-style response rather than merely finding generic misbehavior, so the fuzzer deliberately steers exploration toward predefined target outcomes.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Sec. 3.1 Preliminaries (Formulation): \"a common solution (Zou et al., 2023; Lapid et al., 2023) is to designate the target response as affirmative, such as answers beginning with 'Sure, here is how to [Qi].' By anchoring the target response to text with consistent beginnings, it becomes feasible to express the attack loss function used for optimization in terms of conditional probability.\"; Page 3, Sec. 3.1 (Threat model): \"The objective of jailbreak attacks is to ensure that the responses in R are predominantly answers closely associated with the malicious questions in Q, rather than refusal messages aligned with human values.\"; Page 5, Sec. 3.3 Fitness Evaluation: \"we adopt the log-likelihood that was introduced by Zou et al. (2023) as the loss function, namely, given a specific jailbreak prompt Ji, the loss can be calculated by: L_Ji = -log(P(r_{m+1}, r_{m+2}, ..., r_{m+k} | t_1, t_2, ..., t_m)) ... we define the fitness score of Ji as S_Ji = -L_Ji.\"; Page 5, Alg. 2 AutoDAN-HGA / Sec. 3.5 Termination Criteria: algorithm/control flow uses refusal-keyword list L_refuse and loops \"while model responses have word in Lrefuse and iteration not exhausted do\", showing the search is explicitly checking for and steering against refusal outputs."
