  "value": "High",
  "why": "Unlike traditional fuzzers that apply small, bounded perturbations and risk cumulative drift into semantically invalid inputs, PAIR generates each new candidate entirely via a language model conditioned on high-level, human-interpretable strategies (role-playing, logical appeal, authority endorsement) and in-context examples. This design inherently produces natural, plausible prompts at every iteration, with no evidence of drifting into unrealistic or incoherent text. Because each mutation is a full semantic rewrite rather than an incremental, unconstrained perturbation, all fault-revealing inputs remain within the plausible distribution of natural language prompts throughout the attack.",
  "evidence": "Page 23, Contributions: “Interpretability. PAIR generates prompt-level semantic jailbreaks that are interpretable to humans and includes interpretable, chain-of-thought improvement assessments.”; Page 24, Section II PRELIMINARIES: “We focus on prompt-level jailbreaks, wherein the goal is to craft semantic, human-interpretable prompts that fool a targeted LLM into outputting objectionable content.”; Fig. 2 (p. 24), which contrasts an uninterpretable, noise-like token-level jailbreak with a coherent, plausible prompt-level jailbreak generated by PAIR."
