  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper satisfies both conditions for a 'High' rating. First, it enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing iterations using an explicit validity check. The `is_valid()` function, described in Algorithm 1, constrains mutations by bounding the number of changed pixels and the maximum change in pixel value relative to the original seed input. This prevents the cumulative drift that can lead to unrealistic inputs. Second, the paper provides dedicated empirical evidence that the final fault-inducing inputs are realistic. It uses two standard quantitative, task-specific measures for image naturalness—Inception Score (IS) and Frèchet Inception Distance (FID)—to evaluate the outputs of its fuzzing process. The results in Table XI demonstrate that the images generated under the guidance of the proposed NLC criterion have better naturalness scores compared to other methods and a random baseline.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section VI-B, Triggered Faults: \"is_valid() is adopted from [47], which deems a mutation as valid if 1) the #changed-pixels is less than α × #pixels or 2) the maximum of changed pixel value is less than β × 255. We set α to 0.2 and β to 0.4.\"\nPage 11, Section VI-B, Naturalness of Mutations: \"We measure the naturalness of mutated inputs under each criterion; a good criterion should lead to mutations that mostly preserve the naturalness. We use Inception Score (IS) [39] and Frèchet Inception Distance (FID) [18], which are widely used in the AI and SE community to assess the naturalness of images, as the metrics.\"\nPage 11, Table XI: This table provides the results for IS and FID for various fuzzing configurations, with the accompanying text stating, \"Overall, mutated images guided by NLC have the best scores for both IS and FID.\""
