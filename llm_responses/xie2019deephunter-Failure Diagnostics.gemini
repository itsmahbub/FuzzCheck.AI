  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by analyzing discovered failures in relation to observable model internals (specifically, different coverage criteria) and through statistical analysis of failure patterns (error diversity). It correlates the type of errors found (e.g., quantization errors) with the effectiveness of different coverage criteria, noting that 'corner-region based criteria' are more useful for capturing these specific failures than criteria representing major model behavior. Additionally, it analyzes failure patterns by measuring and comparing the diversity of error categories found by different fuzzing strategies, linking the seed selection strategy to the diversity of detected errors. However, it does not extend this analysis to explain the underlying model vulnerabilities, such as reliance on non-robust features, dataset bias, or overfitting, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section 5.4 RQ4. Error Detection for Quantization, \"We can see that the number of errors found by DeepHunter with different coverage guidance is different. With NBC, DeepHunter found more errors for LeNet-5 and ResNet-20. For MobileNet, errors found with NBC, SNAC, TKNC outnumbers the other two criteria. The result reveals that KMNC and NC, which represent the overall major behavior of DNNs, are relatively not effective in such scenarios. Corner-region based criteria may be more useful to capture quantization errors.\""
