  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces bounded, input-centric perturbations throughout its mutator design and explicitly uses an L_infty constraint (L∞ = 13/255) for all methods, and the mutator logic ensures each pixel is toggled only between original ± ε (so cumulative drift beyond the bound is prevented). These design choices constrain mutations to visually small changes and maintain per-pixel plausibility. However, the paper does not provide any empirical assessment of the perceptual or semantic realism of the final fault-inducing inputs (no human study or task-specific perceptual/fluency metrics such as LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity are reported). According to the metric definition, this corresponds to Medium: plausibility is enforced in mutation design (bounded/rule-based), but the paper omits explicit plausibility validation of final inputs.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.1 Hyperparameters (page 171): \"We use the widely used L∞ metric [4] to restrict perturbations for error-inducing inputs on all compared methods... i.e., L∞ = 13/255 on all datasets (all compared methods use the same setting).\"; Section 3.5 Mutator, \"Perturbation values\" (page 169): \"...we limit the perturbations to each byte to two choices {+ε, −ε}... Given an original input Eo, a current best test case Eb... if Eb[i] = Eo[i], we randomly add perturbation value of +ε or −ε to this byte. If Eb[i] = Eo[i] − ε, we change this byte to Eo[i] + ε. Otherwise, Eb[i] = Eo[i] + ε must hold and we change this byte to Eo[i] − ε.\" (shows per-pixel changes remain within ±ε of original); Section 4.3 Result of Inact-Rate (page 172): \"The Inact-Rate of BET is 0.0%. The perturbations are directly added on pixel values as integers, BET does not suffer the inactivation issue.\" (confirms direct integer pixel edits and bounded changes); Section 4.1 Metrics (page 171): lists evaluation metrics as Err-Num, Label-Num, SR, (and later Inact-Rate) but contains no perceptual or human-evaluation measures (no LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity or human study reported)."
