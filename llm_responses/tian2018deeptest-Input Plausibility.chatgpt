  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper constrains individual mutation steps to realistic, domain-specific image transformations and explicitly uses bounded parameter ranges (Table 4) and a metamorphic/filtering check (Equation 3) to reduce false positives — which enforces plausibility between successive mutation steps. However, the paper composes multiple transformations via a coverage-guided greedy search (Algorithm 1) and explicitly states it does not apply the filtration plausibility check to composite / guided-search images, acknowledging that composed mutations can escape the per-step plausibility checks. Thus plausibility is enforced per mutation step but cumulative drift across iterations/compositions is not fully constrained.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 \"Increasing Coverage with Synthetic Images\" (p. 306): \"DeepTest focuses on generating realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations on seed images and mimic different real-world phenomena like camera lens distortions, object movements, different weather conditions, etc. ... we investigate nine different realistic image transformations (changing brightness, changing contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, blurring, fog effect, and rain effect).\" (Section 3.2, p. 306)\n\nImplementation / parameters (Table 4, p. 307): \"Table 4: Transformations and parameters used by DeepTest for generating synthetic images. ... Translation (tx, ty) (10, 10) to (100, 100) step (10, 10) ... Scale (sx, sy) (1.5, 1.5) to (6, 6) step (0.5, 0.5) ... Rotation q (degree) 3 to 30 with step 3 ... Brightness β (bias) 10 to 100 with step 10\" (Table 4, p. 307)\n\nAlgorithmic composition (Algorithm 1, p. 306–307): \"newImage = ApplyTransforms(image, T1, P1, T2, P2) ... if covInc(newimage) then ... S.push(newImage)\" (Algorithm 1, p. 306–307) — shows greedy stacking of transformations based on coverage increase without an overall plausibility constraint.\n\nFiltration used but not applied to composites (p. 310): \"Thus, we only choose the transformations that obey Equation 3 for counting erroneous behaviors.\" and explicitly: \"We do not enforce the filtration criteria for composite transformations. Rain and fog effects should produce same outputs as original images. Also, in guided search since multiple transformations produce the synthesized images, it is not possible to filter out a single transformation. Thus, for rain, fog, and guided search, we report ...\" (Section RQ4 / results, p. 310)\n\nThreats acknowledgement (Section 6, p. 311): \"DeepTest generates realistic synthetic images by applying different image transformations on the seed images. However, these transformations are not designed to be exhaustive and therefore may not cover all realistic cases.\" (Section 6, p. 311)"
