  "value": "Low",
  "why": "All failures the paper reports are classic model robustness errors (adversarially-induced mispredictions on MNIST digits). The method generates adversarial inputs that cause incorrect class predictions and evaluates distance/iteration metrics; it does not demonstrate uncovering unsafe, biased, toxic, data‑leaking, or security‑critical behaviors, nor does it bypass explicit safety, policy, or defense mechanisms in safety‑aligned or defended models. The paper frames results as misclassification/adversarial examples and uses retraining to improve robustness, which is consistent with discovering low‑severity robustness faults rather than high/medium severity safety or security violations.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.391, Abstract): \"Experimental results on MNIST dataset show that HDTest can generate thousands of adversarial inputs with invisible perturbations that can successfully fool HDC models. On average, HDTest can generate 400 adversarial images within one minute running on commodity computer.\"; Section IV - HDTest Framework (Alg. 1) (p.393, Algorithm 1): comment \"* Indicating successful mis-predcited image generated. */\" (lines 8-11) showing the detection criterion is label disagreement (misprediction); Section V.A - Experimental Setup (p.394, Experimental Setup): \"We use the MNIST database of handwritten digits [30] as our dataset for training and testing the HDC model at an accuracy around 90%.\"; Section V.D - Case Study on Defense Against Adversarial Attacks (p.395, Case Study): \"We run HDTest to generate 1000 adversarial images... after retraining, the rate of successful attack rate drops more than 20%.\" (shows focus on robustness improvement rather than bypassing safety or extracting sensitive information)."
