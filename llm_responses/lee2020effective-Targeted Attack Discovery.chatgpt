  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's testing method (Adapt) is designed to maximize internal coverage (NC, TKNC) by selecting neurons and using their gradients to generate inputs; its exploration is coverage-driven and its oracle checks for newly covered identifiers and misclassification (incorrect labels). The authors evaluate success by coverage increase and by the number/variety of adversarial (misclassified) inputs found. Nowhere does the paper describe steering the fuzzer toward attacker-chosen specific outputs (e.g., forcing a particular target label or phrase) or toward broader semantic security goals (jailbreaks, toxicity). Thus the approach performs untargeted exploration that discovers generic faults (misclassifications/inconsistencies) rather than targeted attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 166, §2.3 (White-Box Testing of Neural Networks): \"One of the main goals of neural network testing is to generate test cases (i.e. input vectors) that maximize a given coverage metric (Cov) in a limited testing budget... Find T = {I1, . . . , In } that maximizes Σ_{Ii ∈ T} Cov(Run(DNN, Ii)).\" ; Page 166, Algorithm 1: mutation step uses gradients of selected neurons to increase their outputs but the objective is coverage (lines showing \"I' ← I' + λ · ∂(Σ_{n∈N} Neuron(n, I'))/∂I'\", and the check \"if Cov(O') ⊈ C ∧ Constraint(I, I') then ...\"). ; Page 172, §4.3 (Adversarial Inputs / Evaluation): \"Table 3 reports the average number of mutations per image (Mutations), the average number of adversarial inputs found per image (Adv. Inputs), the total number of incorrectly classified labels (Labels), and the number of initial inputs (Seeds) from which adversarial inputs were found.\" ; Abstract (page 165): \"Experiments with real-world network models and datasets show that Adapt is remarkably more effective than existing testing techniques in terms of coverage and adversarial inputs found.\""
