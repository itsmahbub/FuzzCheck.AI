  "why": "The paper's proposed method, TACTIC, is explicitly designed to generate realistic test inputs by learning a plausible distribution of environmental conditions from real-world data. It uses a Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (MUNIT) model, a type of GAN, which is trained on datasets of real driving scenes under various conditions (e.g., rain, snow). The test generation process does not involve iterative pixel-level mutations that can accumulate into unrealistic artifacts. Instead, it searches for 'critical' conditions within the learned latent 'style space' of the MUNIT model. The MUNIT generator then synthesizes a new, complete image from an original scene's content and a target style vector. This process inherently constrains the output to the plausible distribution learned by the GAN. The paper further validates the realism of its generated inputs through a dedicated user study, which confirms that the synthesized scenes are significantly more realistic than those from prior methods.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.3, 'Comparison with Baselines on Image Quality', Setup: 'We conduct a user study to evaluate the realism of the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC...'\nPage 8, Section 4.3, Results: 'The results demonstrate that the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC are more realistic than the ones synthesised by affine image transformation (e.g., DeepTest) or high-fidelity simulation (e.g., PreScan) and can better reflect real environments.'\nPage 4, Section 3.1: 'After obtaining a MUNIT model, driving scenes under different environmental conditions of an environmental type can be realistically generated.' This section details how the MUNIT model learns a content space and a style space from real images to generate new, plausible scenes."
