  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's proposed method, LLM-FUZZER, is explicitly designed to maintain the semantic plausibility of the generated inputs (jailbreak prompts) throughout the fuzzing process. The authors acknowledge that traditional mutation operators would produce \"syntactically incorrect or semantically nonsensical inputs.\" To overcome this, they design five mutation operators (Generate, Crossover, Expand, Shorten, Rephrase) that leverage an LLM to perform the mutations. These operators instruct the LLM to perform tasks like rephrasing, blending, or condensing text while preserving meaning. By using an LLM, which is inherently proficient at generating coherent and human-like text, the method ensures that mutated prompts remain within a plausible distribution at every step, directly satisfying the criteria for a 'High' rating. This is not merely a constraint on individual steps but a core feature of the mutation engine that ensures plausibility throughout all iterations.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 3.3 Mutation: \"Directly applying these techniques [traditional fuzzing mutators] to natural language inputs can result in syntactically incorrect or semantically nonsensical inputs, which are unlikely to be effective in jailbreaking LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce distinct mutation methods that leverage LLMs themselves to assist in the mutation process. LLMs, with their proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text, offer a promising approach for crafting coherent and contextually relevant mutations.\""
