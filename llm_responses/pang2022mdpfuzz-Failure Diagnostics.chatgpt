  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight into why failures occur by analyzing observable model internals and statistical failure patterns, but it does not fully tie failures to higher-level root causes such as dataset bias, spurious features, or overfitting. Concretely, the authors (1) analyze neuron activation patterns for crash-triggering vs. normal sequences (t-SNE visualizations and clustering), (2) quantify sensitivity of seeds via a local sensitivity measure (|r - rΔ| / ||ΔS||2) to prioritize inputs, and (3) build and evaluate an abnormal-behavior detector (reporting AUC-ROC) and use findings to repair models and reduce crashes. These constitute substantive diagnostic analyses of model internals and statistical failure patterns (consistent with the metric's \"Medium\" level). However, the paper stops short of attributing failures to underlying vulnerabilities like dataset bias, spurious features, or overfitting, so it does not meet the \"High\" criterion.",
  "evidence": "Page 378, Abstract: \"We show inspiring findings that crash-triggering states, though they look normal, induce distinct neuron activation patterns compared with normal states. We further develop an abnormal behavior detector to harden all the evaluated models and repair them with the findings of MDPFuzz to significantly enhance their robustness without sacrificing accuracy.\"; Page 382, Section 5.1 (Sensitivity) / Alg. 2: \"Sensitivity adds small random permutations ΔS to an initial state S0 ... The local sensitivity of the model at S0 can thus be estimated by |r−rΔ| / ||ΔS||2.\"; Page 387, Section 7.3 (Root Cause Analysis): \"The neuron activations of crash-triggering state sequences found by MDPFuzz have a clear boundary with normal and randomly mutated sequences, which shows that the crash-triggering states can trigger the models’ abnormal internal logics.\"; Page 387, Section 7.4 (Enhance Model Robustness): \"The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) is above 0.78 for each model, indicating that our detector can simultaneously achieve good precision and recall in detecting abnormal model logics.\"; Page 387, Section 7.4 (repair results): \"... the #crash detected by MDPFuzz in 12 hours after model repairing is substantially lower, at 29, than 139 before repairing.\""
