  "why": "The paper's methodology is fundamentally designed to maintain input plausibility for testing models in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It achieves this through a three-pronged approach: 1) It exclusively mutates the initial state of the MDP, preserving the natural and coherent evolution of subsequent states as determined by the environment's dynamics. This design choice inherently prevents the cumulative drift into unrealistic states that can occur when intermediate inputs in a sequence are mutated. 2) It explicitly validates every mutated initial state using environment-specific validation modules and domain knowledge to ensure they represent realistic scenarios. 3) It further constrains mutations to generate only \"solvable\" initial states, meaning a crash is a failure of the model under test, not the result of an impossible starting condition. This comprehensive strategy ensures that discovered failures are triggered by inputs that remain within a plausible distribution.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 6, 'MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation': 'When sampling, the initial states are randomly selected from the state space P. MDPFuzz randomly mutates initial states with small noise. All the mutated states are validated in an automated and deliberate way (see below). That is, we confirm that all mutated states are valid and solvable.'\n\nPage 3, Introduction: 'Second, instead of mutating arbitrary intermediate states, MDPFuzz only mutates the initial state conservatively to ensure that the sequence is realistic. The mutated initial states are also validated in a deliberate way to ensure realism.'\n\nPage 9, Section 6 (on ACAS Xu): 'Moreover, we bound the maximal speed of all airplanes below 1,100 ft/sec, which is within the range of normal speed that a plane can reach in DNN-based ACAS Xu. We guarantee that there exist optimal actions to avoid the crash and solve the initial states, and we do not use an initial state that is not solvable.'"
