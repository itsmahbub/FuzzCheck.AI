  "why": "The paper explicitly designs its method, DeepXplore, to incorporate and enforce domain-specific constraints throughout the input generation process to ensure the resulting test cases are physically realistic. The authors describe a rule-based method that modifies the gradient at each step of the iterative optimization process, guaranteeing that every generated input, not just the final one, adheres to predefined plausibility rules. These constraints are not limited to simple perturbation bounds but model real-world phenomena such as changes in lighting, occlusions from objects, and dirt on a camera lens for image inputs, as well as semantic rules for malware classification inputs (e.g., only adding permissions to an Android manifest, not removing them). This direct and continuous enforcement of realistic, domain-specific constraints ensures that the generated inputs remain within a plausible distribution throughout the fuzzing process.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.2, 'Domain-specific constraints': 'One important aspect of the optimization process is that the generated test inputs need to satisfy several domain-specific constraints to be physically realistic [63]. In particular, we want to ensure that the changes applied to xi during the i-th iteration of gradient ascent process satisfy all the domain-specific constraints for all i. ... Our algorithm ensures this property by modifying the gradient grad (line 13 in Algorithm 1) such that xi+1 = xi + s· grad still satisfies the constraints (s is the step size in the gradient ascent).'\n\nPage 10, Section 6.2, 'Image constraints (MNIST, ImageNet, and Driving)': 'DeepXplore used three different types of constraints for simulating different environment conditions of images: (1) lighting effects for simulating different intensities of lights, (2) occlusion by a single small rectangle for simulating an attacker potentially blocking some parts of a camera, and (3) occlusion by multiple tiny black rectangles for simulating effects of dirt on camera lens.'"
