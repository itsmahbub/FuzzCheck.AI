  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The method, MDPFuzz, mutates the initial state of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by adding small numerical noise. For several of the evaluated scenarios, such as autonomous driving in CARLA and aircraft collision avoidance in ACAS Xu, the mutation involves perturbing continuous state variables (e.g., positions, speeds) with \"small Gaussian float numbers\". The paper emphasizes that mutated states are validated to ensure they are \"valid and solvable\" within the simulation environment. However, there is no mention of considering the effects of standard I/O operations like quantization, rounding, or clipping. The introduced floating-point perturbations are susceptible to being lost or altered during serialization, meaning the discovered failures might not be reproducible. The metric defines this as a 'Low' level of failure reproducibility because it ignores I/O effects, allowing fault-inducing perturbations to be lost after standard serialization.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 6, \"MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation\":\n\n- \"MDPFuzz randomly mutates initial states with small noise.\"\n- \"We add random noise to the initial states and the noise type depends on type of the original data, e.g., adding small Gaussian float numbers from N(0, 1) to vehicles’ initial positions, and adding small uniform integers from U(0, 4) to the ground type in BipedalWalker.\"\n- \"All the mutated states are validated in an automated and deliberate way (see below). That is, we confirm that all mutated states are valid and solvable.\" (The subsequent text clarifies that validation ensures the state is solvable within the simulation, not that the perturbation is robust to I/O operations)."
