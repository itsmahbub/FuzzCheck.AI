  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper applies its fuzzing methodology to two different major Voice Assistant platforms (Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant), which represent distinct models performing the same task of semantic interpretation. The design of the fuzzer, LipFuzzer, explicitly incorporates mechanisms to discover transferable failures. It achieves this by building platform-agnostic 'LAPSUS Models' based on general linguistic knowledge of common speech errors (e.g., pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar) rather than on the specific implementation of any single platform's Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component. By using these general models to generate fault-inducing inputs for applications on both platforms, the paper demonstrates that the same classes of vulnerabilities exist across different models, fulfilling both criteria for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 12, Section VI-C, \"vApp Store Evaluation\": \"1) Experiment Setup: We evaluate LipFuzzer by using templates crawled from the Amazon Alexa Store and Google Assistant Store. For Amazon Alexa Store, we acquired a seed template dataset of 98,261 voice commands from 32,892 vApps. For Google Assistant Store, we gathered 2,328 vApps with 9,044 voice commands.\" This is further supported by Table IV on Page 13, which shows the fuzzing results for both platforms. The design for transferability is evidenced on Page 6, Section IV-A, \"Fuzzing Input & Output\": \"The input of linguistic modeling is linguistic knowledge data shown in 1 of Figure 4. We choose LAPSUS-related linguistic knowledge from multiple sources [12] [26] [1] [20] [24].\" This confirms the models are built from general, platform-agnostic linguistic sources."
