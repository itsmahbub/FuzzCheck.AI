  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs mutation operators and optimization constraints to preserve semantic coherence and limit token-length during every mutation step (using an LLM helper and length hyperparameters), and it provides empirical evidence that final fault-inducing prompts remain realistic: quantitative perplexity measurements (low average perplexity) and a human evaluation (interpretability/naturalness scores and alignment checks) demonstrating that generated prompts are natural and align with human judgments. These elements show both (1) mechanisms that enforce plausibility during fuzzing and (2) empirical validation that the final inputs are perceptually/semantically realistic.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.2 (Template Mutation and Optimization), p.2408: \"In this paper, we propose using GPT-driven mutation operators to create jailbreaking templates, allowing us to preserve the semantic integrity of the generated templates throughout the mutation process.\"; Section 4.2 (Optimization schemes), p.2408–2409: \"Ensuring that the generated adversarial prompts are readable (low perplexity) is crucial... Experiments show that the average perplexity of our generated jailbreak prompts for GPT-3.5 Turbo is as low as 34.61, significantly below the average perplexity threshold of 58.83.\"; Section 4.2 (Optimization schemes), p.2409: \"By customizing the length of these templates (with a default setting of 200 tokens) during the mutation process, we can maintain a high success rate even with shorter prompts when setting system instructions.\"; Section 7 (Human Evaluation), p.2412–2413: \"A total of 30 volunteers participated... For interpretability... Naturalness... The results are summarized in Table 9. We observed that our generated jailbreak prompts match or surpass manually crafted ones in interpretability and naturalness.\"; Section 7 (Human Evaluation), p.2412: \"We observed that for a score of 8 or higher, all outputs were consistently aligned with human evaluation, achieving a 100% alignment rate. This indicates that a score of 8 serves as an appropriate threshold...\"."
