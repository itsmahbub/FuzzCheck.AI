  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper goes beyond merely reporting failures: it introduces and measures neuron coverage (an internal model signal), analyzes neuron activation patterns (e.g., overlap between inputs of same vs different classes), reports how coverage correlates with discovery/diversity of failures, inspects which input features the fuzzer changes for malware/PDF cases, and uses generated failures to diagnose and remedy dataset problems (detecting polluted training labels and improving accuracy via retraining). These analyses link discovered failures to underlying model vulnerabilities such as dataset pollution/bias and limited coverage of learned rules.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.1 (Neuron coverage): \"We define neuron coverage of a set of test inputs as the ratio of the number of unique activated neurons for all test inputs and the total number of neurons in the DNN. We consider a neuron to be activated if its output is higher than a threshold value (e.g., 0).\"\n\nPage 12, Section 7.1 (Benefits of neuron coverage / Activation of neurons for different classes): \"Our results show that inputs coming from the same class share more activated neurons than those coming from different classes. As inputs from different classes tend to get detected through matching of different DNN rules, our result also confirms that neuron coverage can effectively estimate the numbers of different rules activated during DNN testing.\" (Table 7 & surrounding text)\n\nPage 11, Section 7 (Results), Table 3 and Table 4 (examples): Table 3 caption: \"The features added to the manifest file by DeepXplore for generating two sample malware inputs which Android app classifiers (Drebin) incorrectly mark as benign.\" (shows specific manifest features toggled). Table 4 caption: \"The top-3 most in(de)cremented features for generating two sample malware inputs which PDF classifiers incorrectly mark as benign.\" (shows concrete feature changes correlated with failures).\n\nPage 14, Section 7.3 (Detecting training data pollution attack): \"Using this process, we are able to correctly identify 95.6% of the polluted samples.\" (shows they link discovered difference-inducing inputs to dataset pollution and use that for diagnosis).\n\nPage 14, Section 8 (Causes of differences between DNNs): \"The underlying root cause behind prediction differences between two DNNs for the same input is differences in their decision logic/boundaries. As described in §2.1, a DNN's decision logic is determined by multiple factors including training data, the DNN architecture, hyperparameters, etc. Therefore, any differences in the choice of these factors will result in subtle changes in the decision logic of the resulting DNN.\""
