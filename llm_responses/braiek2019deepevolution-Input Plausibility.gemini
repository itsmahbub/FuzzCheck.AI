  "why": "The paper describes a multi-faceted approach to enforce input plausibility throughout the test generation process. Firstly, the search space itself is constrained by manually tuning the parameters of metamorphic transformations to a 'valid domain interval' that preserves input semantics. Secondly, a 'conservative strategy' is adopted to limit the cumulative effect of certain transformations (affine transformations) which are known to potentially generate 'meaningless images.' Finally, the method employs the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) as a filter to explicitly verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original seed inputs, rejecting any candidates that fall below a tuned threshold. This combination of pre-defined boundaries, conservative application, and a final verification filter ensures that mutated inputs remain within a plausible distribution throughout the evolutionary search.",
  "evidence": "Page 455, Section IV-A, Metamorphic Transformation: \"To infer the valid domain interval of each transformation's parameters, we manually tune them to set up the appropriate range of values, i.e., high and low boundaries, that preserves the input semantics before and after each transformation, with respect to the data distribution.\"\n\nPage 455, Section IV-A, Metamorphic Transformation: \"We opted for this conservative strategy that consists of applying only one affine transformation following the pixel-value transformations because applying multiple affine transformations at once would increase the chances of generating meaningless images, i.e., images that don’t occur in real-world situations.\"\n\nPages 455-456, Section IV-A, Metamorphic Transformation: \"To verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original inputs, we compute a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [8] which assesses the similarity between two images... Therefore, we reject mutated synthetic inputs for which SSIM values are lower than a tuned threshold.\"\n\nPage 458, Section VI, Threats to Validity: \"The manual tuning of metamorphic transformations’ domain and the threshold of SSIM could affect the validity of our results. To mitigate this threat, we selected a sample of our generated images using a confidence level of 95% and an error margin of 5%, and verified them manually. We found them to be correct.\""
