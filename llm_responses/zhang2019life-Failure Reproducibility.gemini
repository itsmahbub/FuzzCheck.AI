  "why": "The paper's proposed method, LipFuzzer, generates fault-inducing inputs by mutating voice commands at a high level of abstraction (text, phonemes) and then uses speech synthesis systems (e.g., Amazon Polly, Google Cloud TTS, ESpeak) to create the final audio test cases. This approach generates inputs directly in a serialized format (an audio file like WAV or MP3). The metric definition explicitly states: 'We also consider fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., synthesized speech...) as reproducible under this metric, since such inputs are inherently stable with respect to standard I/O operations.' The perturbations are embedded in the content of the speech itself, not as fragile numerical artifacts on a waveform, and thus are not susceptible to being lost or altered by standard I/O operations like saving and reloading the audio file. Therefore, the method ensures that the generated fault-inducing inputs are reproducible.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section V. IMPLEMENTATION, A. LipFuzzer, subsection \"Speech Synthesis\": \"In order to work with real VA platforms, We generate voice command records to verify the effectiveness of fuzzing results. For machine-generated voice commands, we use two types of speech synthesis methods to generate LAPSUS. The first speech synthesis method (for Phoneme-level) is phoneme-to-speech that is used for phoneme based fuzzing results... The second speech synthesis method is for vocabulary and grammar levels. We direct input fuzzing results generated with LipFuzzer to the above mentioned services and perform a Text-to-Speech conversion.\""
