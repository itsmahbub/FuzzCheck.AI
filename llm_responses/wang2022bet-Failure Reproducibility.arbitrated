  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "While BET explicitly avoids the continuous→discrete inactivation issue by generating and applying integer perturbations directly to pixel/byte values—achieving an Inact-Rate of 0.0% and thus ensuring reproducibility with respect to in-memory discretization—it does not address or evaluate any effects introduced by standard I/O serialization (e.g., image encoding/decoding, lossy formats, PNG/JPEG quantization). There is no discussion of writing inputs to disk or validating that failures persist after common file‐format operations. Hence, the paper provides only a partial treatment of serialization effects, corresponding to a Medium rating under the Failure Reproducibility metric.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.3 (Inact-Rate 0.0%) shows integer‐level perturbations avoid inactivation when mapping floats to ints, but throughout Sections 3–4 there is no consideration of saving/loading via common storage formats (PNG/JPEG) or handling lossy encoding effects."
