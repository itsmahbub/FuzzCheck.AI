{
  "value": "Low",
  "why": "DeepStellar’s fuzzing uncovers adversarial inputs that cause RNNs to misclassify or mistranscribe (robustness errors) but does not target or bypass any explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms, nor does it induce hallucinated, biased, toxic, or otherwise unsafe outputs. The failures are classic model‐robustness mispredictions under small input perturbations, fitting the “Low” severity category.",
  "evidence": "Page 479–480, §3.3 and §5.2: “a mutant is an adversarial sample if it is predicted incorrectly by the network.”\nPage 483, §6.1 (Data Preparation): “we generate … adversarial audios …” and then measure word‐error‐rate, showing the focus is on transcription inaccuracies.\nNo sections of the paper describe testing against defended or safety‐aligned models or bypassing explicit security/safety policies."
