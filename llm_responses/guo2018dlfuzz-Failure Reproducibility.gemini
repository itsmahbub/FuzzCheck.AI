  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper describes DLFuzz's mutation strategy as adding small, gradient-based numerical perturbations directly to the input tensor in memory. The magnitude of these perturbations is controlled by keeping the L2 distance small to ensure they are imperceptible. The methodology does not mention any steps to account for standard I/O operations like clipping, rounding, or quantization. Small numerical changes, such as those generated by this method, are highly likely to be lost or altered when the input is serialized (e.g., saved as an 8-bit image), making the discovered failures fragile and not guaranteed to be reproducible. The paper's description of the mutation and oracle evaluation process completely ignores these serialization effects.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Algorithm 1, line 12: The mutation is a direct numerical addition: `x' = xs + perturbation //mutated input obtained`. Page 4, Section 4, Fuzzing Process: The paper confirms the use of small numerical perturbations measured by L2 distance: 'DLFuzz adopts l2 distance to measure the perturbation with similar computation with [12]. As for the conditions of seed keeping in line 16, DLFuzz limits our desired distance to a relatively small range (less than 0.02) to ensure the imperceptibility.' The paper contains no mention of clipping pixel values to a valid range (e.g., [0, 255]) or any other serialization-aware processing."
