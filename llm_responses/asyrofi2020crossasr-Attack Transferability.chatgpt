  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not demonstrate whether fault-inducing inputs discovered on one model also trigger failures in other models, nor does it present experiments or analyses measuring transferability. CrossASR runs each synthesized audio against multiple ASRs simultaneously (differential testing) and reports per-ASR failure counts, but it does not (a) create inputs targeted at one surrogate ASR and then reuse them to test other ASRs, (b) measure overlap/transfer of failures across models, or (c) claim design choices explicitly intended to discover transferable attacks. The classifier (failure probability predictor) is trained with labels per ASR to predict likely failures, but the approach and experiments focus on efficiently finding failures per ASR rather than on demonstrating or quantifying transferability across ASRs.",
  "evidence": "Page 642, I. Introduction: \"CrossASR performs a black-box differential testing to uncover erroneous behaviors on ASR systems by cross-referencing different ASRs to detect different transcriptions from ASRs.\" \n\nPage 643, II-B Test Selection Engine: \"For this training, a text has m labels, each corresponds to an ASR.\" \n\nPage 646, III-D RQ3 / Table V: \"Table V shows the total number of failed test cases that is generated from the entire 20,000 texts for all combinations of experimented TTSes and ASRs.\" (Table V reports per-ASR failed-case counts but no cross-model transfer/overlap statistics.) \n\nPage 649, VI Conclusion / Future Work: \"In the future, we plan to evaluate CrossASR using additional ASRs and TTSes.\" (Indicates no current evaluation of transferability across broader sets of models.)"
