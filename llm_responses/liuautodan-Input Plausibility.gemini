  "why": "The paper's method, AutoDAN, is explicitly designed to generate 'stealthy' and 'semantically meaningful' jailbreak prompts, which directly corresponds to the metric's concept of input plausibility. The method enforces plausibility throughout its generation process by operating on semantically meaningful units of text (sentences and paragraphs) and employing mutation and initialization operators that are constrained to preserve meaning. First, the genetic algorithm is initialized with human-written, plausible 'handcrafted jailbreak prompts'. Second, its hierarchical genetic operators, such as sentence-level crossover, are designed to maintain structural and semantic coherence. Third, and most critically, the mutation operator uses an LLM-based diversification function with the explicit goal of preserving the 'inherent logical flow and meaning of the original sentences' and the 'global meaning'. The evaluation corroborates this, showing that the generated prompts have a significantly lower perplexity (a measure of linguistic plausibility) than baselines that produce nonsensical text, and can successfully bypass perplexity-based defenses.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section 1: 'We aim to propose a method that preserves the meaningfulness and fluency (i.e., stealthiness) of jailbreak prompts, akin to handcrafted ones, while also ensuring automated deployment as introduced in prior token-level research. As a result, such features ensure that our method can bypass defenses like perplexity detection while maintaining scalability and adaptability.'\n\nPage 6, Section 3.4: 'Subsequently, the prompts after crossover will be conducted a mutation at a probability Pmutation. We let the LLM-based diversification introduced in Alg. 5 to also serve as the mutation function due to its ability to preserve the global meaning and introduce diversity.'\n\nPage 7, Table 1: The 'Attack effectiveness and Stealthiness' table shows that on the Llama2-7b-chat model, the proposed AutoDAN-HGA method achieves a Perplexity (PPL) of 54.3820, which is dramatically lower and thus more plausible than the GCG baseline's PPL of 1027.5585, and is comparable to the Handcrafted DAN's PPL of 22.9749."
