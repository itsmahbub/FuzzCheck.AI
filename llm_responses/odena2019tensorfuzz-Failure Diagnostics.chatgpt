  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight based on observable model internals: it adopts activation-level signals (using activations / logits and ANN nearest-neighbor checks) as its coverage metric and uses those internals during analysis. In the experiments the authors inspect internal activations to explain specific failures (e.g., NaNs caused by extreme logits and a broken loss implementation; saturated gradients caused by discriminator outputs of large magnitude). However, the diagnostic work is limited to these concrete cases and to coverage-related choices; the paper does not perform broader statistical failure-pattern analyses (e.g., class-level error concentration, distributional proximity analyses) nor does it link discovered failures to higher-level model vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting. This matches the definition of Medium: the paper analyzes observable internals and correlates failures with those signals, but stops short of deeper, general explanations tying failures to broader sources of vulnerability.",
  "evidence": "Section 5 (Coverage Analyzer): \"we elect to use nearest neighbor algorithms to determine if two sets of neural network 'activations' are meaningfully different from each other. This provides a coverage metric...\"; also \"When fuzzing whole classifiers, we find it is often possible to obtain good results by tracking only the logits, or the layer before the logits.\" (Section 5, Coverage Analyzer). Section 6 (Experimental Results) — NaNs: \"Inspecting the classifier when exposed to the image on the right, we see that the NaN surfaces because there was one logit with a very positive value and one logit with a very negative value, which broke the loss calculation.\" (Section 6, Numerical errors experiment). Section 6 (Experimental Results) — DCGAN loss bug: \"The input was one in which the output of the discriminator had too high a magnitude, which caused the incorrectly implemented loss function to have saturating gradients.\" (Section 6, Tests on popular model implementations). Section 6 (Experimental Results) — Quantization disagreements: \"With these settings, the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried.\" (Section 6, Quantization experiment) — this reports failure incidence but contains no deeper statistical or vulnerability analysis."
