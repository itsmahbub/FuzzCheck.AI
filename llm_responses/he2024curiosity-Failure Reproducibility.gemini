  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper describes its mutation strategy as applying 'a small random perturbation to a selected state'. The validation of these mutated states focuses on ensuring they are legal within the specific domain of the simulation environment, such as preventing initial collisions in CARLA or staying within speed limits in ACAS Xu. The methodology does not mention or account for standard I/O operations like rounding, quantization, or clipping that would occur during serialization to a storage format. The checks performed are for domain-validity, not for I/O-reproducibility. Consequently, the small numerical perturbations introduced during fuzzing could be fragile and lost upon serialization, which means failures may not be reproducible. This approach aligns with the 'Low' rating, as it ignores I/O effects during both mutation and oracle evaluation.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 6, Seed Mutation: 'Once a seed is selected from the corpus, the Seed-Mutation function generates a new mutated state by applying a small random perturbation to a selected state. ... We need to ensure that the mutated seed lies in the legitimate state spaces, and the mutated seed would not trigger an initial crash.'\nPage 7, Section 4.2.1, Autonomous Driving: 'When CUREFUZZ mutates a given state, small perturbations are randomly generated and added to the positions and angles of these vehicles. We use the CARLA simulator itself to check for the validity of the mutated state. All illegally mutated states and the states that trigger initial collision are discarded in our experiments.'\nPage 7, Section 4.2.2, Aircraft Collision Avoidance: 'Given the predefined range of acceptable states, states that fall outside legal space are automatically discarded.'"
