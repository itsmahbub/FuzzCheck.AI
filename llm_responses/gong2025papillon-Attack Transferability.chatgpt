  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly evaluates and demonstrates that fault-inducing prompts generated by PAPILLON on one model can be reused to successfully attack other models (cross-model and multimodal transfer experiments are reported). However, the PAPILLON design and mutation operators are described with goals of semantic coherence, short prompt length, and seed-pool/fuzzing effectiveness rather than with explicit mechanisms specifically intended to discover or maximize transferability across different model implementations (no surrogate-model training, ensemble surrogate testing, or transfer-focused mutators are described). Therefore the work shows reuse/testing of fault-inducing inputs for transferability but does not present an explicit design aimed at producing transferable attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 2401, Abstract: \"Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.\"; Page 2412, Section 5.4 (Attack Transferability): \"We further investigate the transferability of PAPILLON. Transferability refers to the extent to which prompts designed to jailbreak the target model can successfully jailbreak another model.\" and \"Overall, PAPILLON demonstrates notable attack transferability across different models.\"; Page 2420, Table 17 (Cross-model transferability): shows the cross-model success-rate matrix (e.g., \"Baichuan2-7B -> Vicuna-7B-v1.3: 70%\", many non-zero cross-model ASR entries); Page 2407, Section 4.2 (Template Mutation and Optimization): \"we design three novel question-dependent mutation strategies capable of generating mutations with semantic meaning and limited token length by leveraging the power of an LLM helper.\" (describes focus on semantic coherence and prompt length rather than explicit transferability mechanisms)."
