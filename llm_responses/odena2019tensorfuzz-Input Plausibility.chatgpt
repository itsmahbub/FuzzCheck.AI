  "why": "The paper explicitly enforces plausibility constraints on mutated inputs throughout the fuzzing process for common input types (images and sequences). It (1) restricts inputs to valid neural-network inputs (shape, pixel range, vocabulary), (2) provides a mutation mode that constrains the L∞ difference between a mutated input and the original element from which it is descended (thereby bounding cumulative drift), and (3) clips mutated images to the training-range. The authors also demonstrate using an L∞ ball around seed images in experiments (quantization test). These mechanisms ensure mutated inputs remain within a plausible input distribution across fuzzing iterations.",
  "evidence": "Section 4 (An Overview of the TensorFuzz Library), p. 4: \"In TensorFuzz, we restrict the inputs to those that are valid neural network inputs. If the inputs are images, we restrict our inputs to have the correct size and shape, and to lie in the same interval as the input pixels of the dataset under consideration. If the inputs are sequences of characters, we only allow characters that are in the vocabulary extracted from the training set.\"; Section 5 (Details of the TensorFuzz Library — Mutator), p. 5: \"The second is to add white noise, but to constrain the difference between the mutated element and the original element from which it is descended to have a user-configurable L∞ norm. ... In both types of image mutation we clip the image after mutation so that it lies in the same range as the inputs used to train the neural network being fuzzed.\"; Section 6 (Experimental Results), p. 6: \"We then ran the fuzzer with mutations restricted to lie in a radius 0.4 infinity norm ball surrounding the seed images...\""
