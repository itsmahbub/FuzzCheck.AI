  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly enforces plausibility at the mutation step level — using an LLM helper with system-prompt instructions to maintain semantic coherence, controlling output token length, and measuring/targeting low perplexity for generated templates — but it does not describe any explicit mechanism that constrains or measures cumulative drift across multiple fuzzing iterations (e.g., distance-to-seed constraints, distributional projection, or iterative plausibility checks). Thus PAPILLON enforces plausibility between successive mutation steps (bounded/ rule-based via LLM prompts, length and perplexity controls) but overlooks formal safeguards against accumulation of small mutations over many iterations.",
  "evidence": "Page 2408, Section 4.2 (Template Mutation and Optimization): \"We control both semantic coherence and prompt length through system prompt instructions and the hyperparameter of the output length respectively.\" Page 2408, same section: \"Ensuring that the generated adversarial prompts are readable (low perplexity) is crucial... In this paper, we propose using GPT-driven mutation operators to create jailbreaking templates, allowing us to preserve the semantic integrity of the generated templates throughout the mutation process. Experiments show that the average perplexity of our generated jailbreak prompts for GPT-3.5 Turbo is as low as 34.61...\" Page 2407, Section 4.1 (Framework of PAPILLON): \"...the mutated seeds are evaluated using a judge model to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful jailbreaks. Successful jailbreaking templates are retained in the seed pool, while unsuccessful ones are discarded.\" Page 2409, Section 5.1 (Experimental Setup): \"The length of the generated prompts is controlled using the max_new_tokens hyperparameter. Specifically, for the 'role-play' and 'contextualization' mutations, this value is set to 200 tokens, while an additional 100 tokens are allocated for the 'expand' mutation.\" (These excerpts show per-mutation coherence and length/perplexity controls but the paper contains no description of mechanisms that explicitly prevent or monitor cumulative drift across many iterations.)"
