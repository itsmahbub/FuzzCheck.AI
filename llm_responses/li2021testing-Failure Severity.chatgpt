  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's TACTIC method uncovers behaviours that violate safety expectations of autonomous driving systems (large steering-angle divergences under realistic environmental conditions), i.e., unsafe/undesired outputs that could lead to accidents. However, the paper does not claim or demonstrate bypassing explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms (it targets standard pre-trained driving models and measures steering divergences), nor does it target defended/safety-aligned models or security-critical violations like data leakage or unauthorized actions. Thus the uncovered failures are safety-impactful but not shown to bypass explicit defenses, matching the 'Medium' severity definition.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Introduction: \"erroneous or unexpected behaviours that can lead to catastrophic accidents\".\nPage 4, Section 3.2.2 Metamorphic Error Analysis: \"Then the MR is defined as |θo − θt| < ϵ, where the ϵ is a user-defined error bound.\" and \"If the new driving scenes synthesised with this style vector have larger steering angle divergences compared with the original driving scenes, then the style vector is considered to be able to detect more erroneous behaviours.\"\nPage 5, Section 4.2 Results: \"Compared with Rc and DeepRoad, TACTIC detects many more erroneous behaviours in all environmental types for both four error bounds.\" (see Table 1 and Table 2 reporting large numbers of steering-angle errors at 10°, 20°, 30°, 40° thresholds).\n(Section names and quotes taken directly from the paper: Introduction; 3.2.2 Metamorphic Error Analysis; 4.2 Comparison with Baselines on Effectiveness; Tables 1–2.)"
