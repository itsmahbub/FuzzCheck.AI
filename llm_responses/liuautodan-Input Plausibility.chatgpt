  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs mutations and initialization to preserve semantic plausibility across iterations: population initialization uses handcrafted prototypes revised by an LLM to \"preserve the inherent logical flow and meaning\"; the same LLM-based diversification is used as the mutation operator to \"preserve the global meaning and introduce diversity\"; sentence-level operations (momentum word scoring, synonym replacement) and hierarchical (sentence/paragraph) crossover operate at linguistic units rather than arbitrary token noise. Empirically, AutoDAN achieves low sentence perplexity (PPL) compared to token-level baselines (GCG), and it successfully bypasses perplexity-based defenses — indicating that generated inputs remain realistic/semantically meaningful throughout optimization. These design choices and measurements show the method enforces input plausibility throughout fuzzing iterations rather than only bounding single-step perturbations.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.2 Population Initialization: \"To preserve the basic features of the prototype handcrafted jailbreak prompt while also promoting diversification, we employ LLMs as the agents responsible for revising the prototype prompt... the modifications proposed by LLM can preserve the inherent logical flow and meaning of the original sentences, while simultaneously introducing diversity in word selection and sentence structure.\"; Page 5, Section 3.4 Genetic Policies: \"We let the LLM-based diversification introduced in Alg. 5 to also serve as the mutation function due to its ability to preserve the global meaning and introduce diversity.\"; Appendix B (Alg. 5), Page 13: Algorithm 5 LLM-based Diversification: \"messageuser ← 'Please revise the following sentence with no change to its length and only output the revised version, the sentence is: prompt'\"; Page 6, Section 4.2 Results / Table 1 (Attack Effectiveness and Stealthiness): reporting PPL values and stating \"Compared with the baseline, our method exhibits superior performance in terms of PPL, indicating more semantically meaningful and stealthy attacks being generated.\"; Page 8, Section 4.2 Effectiveness against defense: \"the semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts AutoDAN (and the original handcrafted DAN) is not influenced. These findings underscore the capability of our method to generate semantically meaningful content similar to benign text, verifying the stealthiness of our method.\"; Appendix D.2 (Implementation), Page 16: hyper-parameters include \"a mutation rate of 0.01\", showing mutations are infrequent and LLM-guided."
