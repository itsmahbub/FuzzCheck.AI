  "why": "The paper does not demonstrate or report experiments where fault-inducing inputs (LAPSUS) discovered on one model/target are reused to test other models to show cross-model transferability. Although LipFuzzer is applied to both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant stores (i.e., the authors run the tool on multiple platforms), the stated evaluation goals and the described experiments focus on finding and verifying LAPSUS per platform. The paper does not present (a) an explicit experiment that generates faults on a surrogate model and then reuses those same inputs on different/unknown target models, nor (b) design elements explicitly aimed at discovering or measuring the transferability of discovered fault-inducing inputs across independently implemented models performing the same task.",
  "evidence": "Section/Pages and quotes from the paper:\n\n1) Abstract (p.1): \"We also use LipFuzzer to evaluate both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant vApp platforms.\" — supports that both platforms were evaluated but does not indicate reuse/transfer experiments.\n\n2) Evaluation goals (Section VI, p.11): \"More specifically, our evaluation has three goals: (i) We empirically verify that the problematic Intent Classifier can lead to speech misinterpretation related to LAPSUS. (ii) We show LipFuzzer's performance in terms of the LAPSUS Models' accuracy and effectiveness. (iii) We use LipFuzzer to reveal that problematic templates widely exist in both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant platforms.\" — none of these goals mentions generating fault-inducing inputs on one model and testing them on other models to assess transferability.\n\n3) vApp store experiment setup (Section VI-C, p.12): \"we apply the same LAPSUS Models used in LipFuzzer evaluation.\" and \"we evaluate LipFuzzer by using templates crawled from the Amazon Alexa Store and Google Assistant Store.\" — indicates application across stores but does not describe experiments that generate LAPSUS on one platform and then reuse them to test the other platform as a transferability study.\n\n(These quotes are from the paper's Abstract, Section VI (Evaluation), and Section VI-C (vApp Store Evaluation).)"
