  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's method operates directly on textual prompts (discrete, serialized text) rather than applying fine-grained numeric mutations to in-memory floating-point tensors. AutoDAN generates final jailbreak prompts as text strings (via sentence- and word-level crossover/mutation and LLM-based diversification) and evaluates success using textual oracles (keyword checks and an LLM re-check). Because inputs are produced as serialized text (generated prompts) and the oracle operates on model text outputs, the failures do not rely on fragile in-memory numerical perturbations that could be lost by standard I/O serialization (quantization/rounding). Thus, under the metric definition—where approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., generated text) are considered reproducible—AutoDAN ensures reproducibility under standard I/O operations.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.1): \"AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm.\"; Section 3.4.2 (p.5), paragraph describing hierarchical view: \"Our method views the jailbreak prompt as a combination of paragraph-level population, i.e., different combination of sentences, while these sentences, in turn, are formed by sentence-level population, for example, different words.\"; Section 4.2 (p.8): \"We conduct these evaluations by generating a jailbreak prompt for each malicious request in the dataset and testing the final responses from the victim LLM.\"; Appendix B, Alg.5 (p.13): \"Please revise the following sentence with no change to its length and only output the revised version, the sentence is: prompt\" (shows the mutation/generation operates on serialized text strings)."
