  "why": "The paper describes a differential testing framework that runs multiple ASR systems in parallel and uses cross-referencing to identify failed cases, and it leverages failures to generate transformed test texts. However, it does not demonstrate or evaluate whether fault-inducing inputs discovered on one model are reused to test other (unseen) target models, nor does it describe explicit mechanisms or experiments aimed at measuring cross-model transferability of faults. All descriptions pertain to comparing outputs across selected ASR systems within the same test run and generating transformations from observed failures, but no reuse-on-surrogate → test-on-other-model workflow or transferability analysis is presented.",
  "evidence": "Page 461, Section II (Tool Design): \"If there exists at least one system that can correctly transcribe the audio while a specific ASR system fails to do so, we say that a failed test case is uncovered for this specific ASR system.\" \n\nPage 461-462, Section III (Core Functionalities): \"The ASR systems currently available in ASDF are DeepSpeech [19], wav2letter [20], and wav2vec2 [21].\" and \"Cross-referencing is performed amongst the selected ASR systems to ensure that the test cases are valid and can be determined by at least one ASR service.\" \n\nPage 462, Section IV (Usage): \"A transformed text input must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR service to be deemed valid (or determinable); otherwise, it is deemed indeterminable and discarded.\" \n\n(There are no sections or quotes in the paper that describe generating fault-inducing inputs on a surrogate model and then reusing them to test other unseen target models, nor experiments measuring transferability across models.)"
