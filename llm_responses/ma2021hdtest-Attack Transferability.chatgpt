  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not demonstrate or evaluate whether adversarial / fault-inducing inputs generated on one HDC model transfer to other models performing the same task. All experiments generate and use adversarial inputs against a single HDC classifier on MNIST (including using generated inputs to retrain that same classifier). The paper does not report reusing seeds/adversarial inputs on other independently-trained HDC models, nor does it include explicit cross-model transferability experiments or mechanisms designed to test transfer across different model implementations.",
  "evidence": "V.A Experimental Setup (page 394): \"We use the MNIST database of handwritten digits [30] as our dataset for training and testing the HDC model at an accuracy around 90%.\"  V.D Case Study on Defense Against Adversarial Attacks (page 395): \"First, for a specific HDC model, we run HDTest to generate 1000 adversarial images. ... We feed the first subset of adversarial images to the HDC model with correct labels to retrain the HDC model ... Next, we use the second subset of adversarial images to attack the HDC model. Our experimental results show that, after retraining, the rate of successful attack rate drops more than 20%.\"  V.E Discussion (page 395): \"While we only consider one dataset in this paper due to the fact that HDC is still exploring its use in image classification domain, HDTest can be naturally extended to other HDC model structures because it considers a general greybox assumption with only HV distance information.\""
