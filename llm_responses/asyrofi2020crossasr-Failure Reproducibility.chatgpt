  "why": "CrossASR generates test inputs by synthesizing speech audio from text via Text-To-Speech (TTS) engines and represents each test case as a tuple that includes the TTS-generated audio. That is, inputs are produced directly as serialized audio artifacts (speech audio files) rather than as ephemeral in-memory floating-point perturbations. Because CrossASR feeds these synthesized audio artifacts to ASRs and records them as part of the generated test cases (s in the 5-tuple), the failures it detects are based on persisted, serialized inputs and thus are stable with respect to standard I/O (quantization/rounding/clipping) effects. The paper also indicates metamorphic transformations are future work, implying the current approach does not rely on fine-grained numerical mutations that could be lost on serialization.",
  "evidence": "Section II-A (Architecture), p. 642: \"Each piece of text in the batch is then fed into the Text-To-Speech Engine (TTS). The TTS converts the Text into a Speech Audio. The Speech Audio is then fed to the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Engines.\"; Section II-A (Architecture), p. 642: \"Each 5-tuple is of the format t, s, a, t', l, where t is the input text, s is the TTS generated audio, a is the ASR used to transcribe t, t' is the ASR transcribed text, and l is the status of the test case.\"; Conclusion (VI), p. 649: \"We want to add some metamorphic transformations to generate more speech audios that can lead to failed test cases.\" (indicating such transformations are future work and not the current source of test mutations)."
