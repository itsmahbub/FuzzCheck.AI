  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly enforces a distance-based plausibility constraint on generated inputs throughout the iterative white-box fuzzing process (both in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2) and uses hyper-parameter choices to limit cumulative drift. The algorithms only accept mutated inputs when Constraint(I, I') holds (the paper defines Constraint as an L2-distance threshold to the original seed), and in experiments the authors report that all techniques (including Adapt) maintained the L2 distance to the original input (≈0.05 on average). These design and experimental statements show that Adapt enforces input plausibility across fuzzing iterations rather than only per-step, preventing unrealistic drift and thus meeting the metric's requirement for ensuring mutated inputs remain within a plausible input distribution.",
  "evidence": "Section 2.3 (White-Box Testing of Neural Networks) / Algorithm 1 (page 166): \"if Cov(O') ⊈ C ∧ Constraint(I, I') then\" and example: \"For example, Constraint(I, I') is true if L2 distance between I and I' is less than a certain threshold.\"; Section 3.2 (White-Box Testing with Online Learning) / Algorithm 2 (page 168): algorithm uses the same check at line 16: \"if Cov(O') ⊈ C ∧ Constraint(I, I') then\"; Section 3.2 (Hyperparameters) (page 169): \"The second hyper-parameter η1 is the number of times that the set of selected neurons is used for generating new inputs... We manually set the η1 to 3 so that the distance is not too far.\"; Section 4.1 (Experimental setup) (page 170): \"All the techniques, including Adapt, performed testing while maintaining the L2-distance between the initial and mutated inputs within 0.05 on average.\""
