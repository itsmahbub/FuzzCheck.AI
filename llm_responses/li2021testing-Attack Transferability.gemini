  "why": "The paper proposes a method, TACTIC, to identify critical environmental conditions for a specific, or 'subject', Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Autonomous Driving System (ADS). The search for these conditions is guided by model-specific metrics, such as neuron coverage and steering angle divergence, which are calculated on the subject model. The experimental evaluation involves three different ADS models (Dave-orig, Dave-dropout, Chauffeur). However, the TACTIC framework is executed independently for each model to find its specific critical conditions. The paper does not contain any experiments or discussion on whether the fault-inducing environmental conditions discovered for one model also cause erroneous behavior in the other models. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the transferability of the discovered failures.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.3, \"Search of Critical Environmental Conditions\": \"TACTIC receives as inputs the subject DNN-based ADS N, the MUNIT model M trained for the given environmental type, and a set Io of the original driving scenes.\" This statement clarifies that the method is designed to operate on a single 'subject' model 'N' at a time. \n\nPage 7, Section 4.2, \"Comparison with Baselines on Effectiveness\", paragraph \"Setup\": \"We execute TACTIC with two coverage-guiding strategies: KMNC (denoted as TACTIC KMNC ) and NBC (denoted as TACTIC NBC ), respectively, on each of the three subject DNN-based ADSs, under the five environmental types.\" This shows that the experiments were run separately for each of the three models, rather than generating inputs on one and testing them on others. The results are then presented independently for each model, confirming the lack of a transferability analysis."
