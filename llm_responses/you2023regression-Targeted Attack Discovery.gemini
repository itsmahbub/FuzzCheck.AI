  "why": "The paper's proposed method, DRFuzz, performs untargeted exploration to discover generic regression faults. A regression fault is defined as any input that was correctly predicted by a prior model version but is incorrectly predicted by the new version. The fuzzing strategy is explicitly designed to amplify the prediction difference between the two model versions, thereby increasing the chance of finding any disagreement that constitutes a regression fault. The method does not incorporate a mechanism to steer the search toward a specific, predefined target output (e.g., misclassifying a 'cat' as a 'dog'). Instead, it aims to find as many diverse regression faults as possible, which are a form of prediction inconsistency.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section II, Definition 2: 'Regression fault. Given a prior version model M1, its regression model M2, a test input x, and its ground truth label y, x is called to trigger a regression fault if x is correctly predicted by M1, yet wrongly predicted by M2, i.e., cM1[x] = y ∧ cM2[x] ≠ y.' This definition confirms that any misclassification by the new model (cM2[x] ≠ y) constitutes a fault, without specifying a target class for the misprediction. \n\nPage 4, Section III-C: 'With this expectation, we design a search strategy in DRFuzz to guide the generation of test inputs toward the direction of amplifying the prediction difference between versions. In this way, fault-triggering test inputs can be generated more efficiently.' The guiding heuristic is the amplification of prediction difference in general, not steering towards a specific attacker-chosen outcome."
