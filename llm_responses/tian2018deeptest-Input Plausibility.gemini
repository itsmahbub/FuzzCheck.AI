  "why": "The method is explicitly designed to generate inputs by mimicking realistic, real-world phenomena. The transformations applied to seed images include weather effects (rain, fog), lighting changes (brightness, contrast), and physical changes (rotation, shear, scaling) intended to be plausible. This enforces plausibility at the level of individual mutation steps. However, the paper's greedy algorithm for combining these transformations is driven solely by increasing neuron coverage, without an explicit mechanism to check if the combined transformations result in a plausible image, thus potentially overlooking cumulative effects. The paper does perform a final assessment of the plausibility of the failure-inducing inputs, but this is an informal, manual check by the authors rather than a formal human study or the use of quantitative perceptual metrics.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2, 'Increasing Coverage with Synthetic Images': 'Therefore, DeepTest focuses on generating realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations on seed images and mimic different real-world phenomena like camera lens distortions, object movements, different weather conditions, etc. To this end, we investigate nine different realistic image transformations (changing brightness, changing contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, blurring, fog effect, and rain effect).' \nPage 6, Section 3.3, 'Algorithm 1': The greedy search algorithm for combining transformations checks only for coverage increase ('if covInc(newimage) then') and does not include a plausibility check for the resulting 'newImage'.\nPage 10, Section 5, 'RQ4': 'We also manually checked the bugs reported in Table 8 and report the false positives in Figure 8. It also shows two synthetic images (the corresponding original images) where DeepTest incorrectly reports erroneous behaviors while the model’s output is indeed safe. Although such manual investigation is, by definition, subjective and approximate, all the authors have reviewed the images and agreed on the false positives.'"
