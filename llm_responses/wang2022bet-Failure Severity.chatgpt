  "why": "The paper describes BET as a black-box testing method that finds \"error-inducing inputs\" which cause mispredictions or inconsistencies (e.g., between a model and its quantized versions). All experiments and metrics (Err-Num, Label-Num, SR, Inact-Rate) focus on misclassification and disagreement detection and on improving model accuracy via fine-tuning. The paper does not describe discovering or exploiting safety/policy/security mechanisms (e.g., jailbreaks, data leakage, unauthorized actions) nor testing defended or safety-aligned models to bypass explicit safeguards. Therefore the failures uncovered are robustness errors (mispredictions/inconsistencies) rather than high- or medium-severity safety/security violations.",
  "evidence": "Page 164, Abstract: \"It is important to test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify defects (e.g. error-inducing inputs) before deploying them in security-sensitive scenarios.\" \n\nPage 164-165, Introduction: \"They aim at identifying defects of CNN models such as finding adversarial inputs which induce errors. These error-inducing inputs can be used to fine-tune the model to improve its classification accuracy.\" \n\nPage 166, Section 2.2 (Related Work): \"There are two common scenarios for CNN testing, i.e., differential testing (DT) [31, 46] and single model testing (ST) [12, 19]. DT finds error-inducing inputs which trigger behavior inconsistencies among multiple models... ST only focuses on one target model... an error-inducing input x_err is found if C(x_err) ≠ l.\" \n\nPage 171, Section 4.2 (Evaluation of Black-Box Differential Testing): \"we try to generate error-inducing inputs that cause disagreements between the original model with its quantized models. e.g., generating error-inducing inputs between ResNet50 with ResNet50-q8.\" \n\nPage 172, Tables and Evaluation (4.3 & 4.4): metrics and results (Err-Num, Label-Num, SR, Inact-Rate) all measure misclassifications, label diversity, and success in finding error-inducing inputs; Section 4.4 shows such inputs are used to fine-tune models to \"improve target models’ accuracy by 2 ∼ 3%.\" (no discussion of bypassing defenses or inducing unsafe/hallucinatory/toxic outputs)."
