  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzing method, HDTest, applies numerical mutation strategies like adding Gaussian and random noise to input images. The methodology does not describe any mechanism to account for standard input/output (I/O) serialization effects such as quantization (rounding floating-point pixel values to integers) or clipping (ensuring pixel values remain within the valid [0, 255] range for 8-bit images). The fuzzing loop feeds the mutated inputs, which likely exist as in-memory floating-point arrays after mutation, directly to the model for evaluation. This allows for the possibility that discovered failures are caused by small numerical perturbations that would be lost or altered if the adversarial image were saved to a standard file format (e.g., PNG) and then reloaded. Consequently, the reproducibility of the generated failures is not guaranteed.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Table I lists mutation strategies including `gauss` and `rand` which are described as 'apply gaussian noise over the entire image' and 'apply random noise over the entire image'. The paper's algorithm and experimental setup sections do not mention any steps for handling quantization or clipping. Algorithm 1 on page 3 shows that mutated `seeds` are generated (Line 6) and then directly fed to the model `y_seeds = HDC(seeds)` (Line 7) without any intermediate serialization step to ensure the perturbations would persist."
