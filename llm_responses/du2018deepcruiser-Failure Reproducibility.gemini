  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method, DeepCruiser, uses a set of semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations on audio signals (e.g., changing volume, adding noise, altering speed) to generate test inputs. According to the metric definition, using such transformations without explicit handling of I/O effects provides only partial enforcement of failure reproducibility. The paper discusses applying these transformations with 'restraints' to ensure the generated audio is still recognizable by humans, thus preserving the metamorphic relation. However, it makes no mention of accounting for serialization effects like quantization, rounding, or clipping that occur when audio is saved to standard file formats. The test generation and oracle evaluation process described in the paper operates on the mutated audio directly without an intermediate save/load cycle, which could lead to the detection of failures caused by fragile numerical artifacts that would not persist after standard I/O operations. Therefore, the approach fits the 'Medium' category as it applies semantic-preserving transformations without explicitly enforcing reproducibility under serialization.",
  "evidence": "Page 12, Section 6.1, 'Metamorphic Transformations of Audio Signals': 'Inspired by these practical scenarios, we derive a set of transformation operators to mimic the environment interference. Overall, they can be classified into four categories: – Volume-related transformations (VRT): ChangeVolume, LowPassFilter, HighPassFilter. – Speed-related transformations (SRT): PitchShift, ChangeSpeed. – Clearness-related transformations (CRT): AddWhiteNoise, ExtractHarmonic – Unaffected transformations (UAT): DRC, Trim.'\nPage 13, Section 6.1: 'To generate suitable defect-triggering candidates, we apply the transformations with restraints to ensure that the audio seeds and the corresponding mutants sound the same to human beings. Transformation operators satisfying the above requirements are said to keep a metamorphic relation [41] and we refer to them as metamorphic transformations.'\nPage 14, Section 6.2, 'Coverage-Guided Testing': 'DeepCruiser will generate a new audio a’ with transformation t and perform the transformation with the deep learning system R. If the prediction result is inconsistent with the original seed, a’ will be added into the failed tests. For audio in ASR, we decide a failed test by checking whether the Word/Character Error Rate (W/CER) exceeds a certain threshold.' This description of the workflow does not include steps for saving and reloading the audio to ensure perturbations survive serialization."
