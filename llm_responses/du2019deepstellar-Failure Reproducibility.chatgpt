  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper uses semantic-preserving, metamorphic transformations and synthesized inputs (e.g., audio augmentation and TTS-generated reference audios) as its primary mutation and test-generation mechanisms, which provide partial robustness to I/O effects. However, the paper does not explicitly account for serialization effects (quantization, clipping, rounding, or encoding) during mutation or oracle evaluation, nor does it state constraints to ensure that fault-inducing numerical perturbations survive typical serialization. Therefore, it neither enforces end-to-end reproducibility under standard I/O nor completely ignores metamorphic/serialized-input approaches; this matches the metric's “Medium” level (metamorphic transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization).",
  "evidence": "Section 5.2 (Coverage-Guided Testing of RNNs), p. 482: \"For CGT, we mainly focus on image classification and apply the metamorphic mutation strategy [55] for generating new mutants that would keep the prediction meaning from the human’s perspective during testing.\"; Section 5.1 (Adversarial Sample Detection for RNNs), p. 481: \"For ASR, given an audio input a that is transcribed to texts t by the RNN, we generate the reference audios using off-the-shelf text-to-speech engines (e.g., Google cloud text-to-speech [4]) that generate the audio t with correct and clear pronouncing.\"; Section 6.1 (Data Preparation), p. 483: \"For each ASR model, we generate 10,000 perturbed audios from original benign ones with existing audio data augmentation techniques [5] (i.e., speed and volume adjustment, low/high-frequency filtering, noise blending).\"  (No text in the paper discusses explicit handling of quantization, clipping, rounding, or other serialization effects when producing or evaluating mutated inputs.)"
