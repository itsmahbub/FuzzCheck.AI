  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The failures uncovered by TESTRNN are limited to mispredictions—both adversarial examples (small‐perturbation misclassifications) and backdoor‐triggered misclassifications—without demonstrating the bypass of any explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms in defended or safety‐aligned models. There is no evidence of inducing unsafe or unauthorized behaviors (such as jailbreaks, data leakage, or toxic/hallucinatory outputs), only prediction inconsistencies under input mutations or backdoor triggers. This aligns with the “Low” severity class, which covers robustness errors without exposing unsafe behavior or bypassing defenses.",
  "evidence": "Section VI-C (Test Set Evaluation): “A test case x′ is said to not pass the oracle if x′ is within the norm-ball of some known sample x … and if x′ has a different classification from x … a test case does not pass the oracle is an adversarial sample.”\n\nSection VII-C1 and VII-C2: All reported failures are misclassifications (adversarial examples and backdoor inputs) on undefended models; no experiments on adversarially trained or safety-aligned models are reported."
