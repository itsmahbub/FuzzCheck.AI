  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process by design, and provides empirical evidence that the discovered fault-inducing inputs are realistic. The fuzzer, LipFuzzer, is explicitly a \"linguistic-model-guided\" tool that generates mutations based on models of plausible human speech errors, termed LAPSUS. These models are constructed from real-world linguistic knowledge (e.g., pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar rules) and are statistically trained using data from a human user study. This ensures that the generated voice commands are not random or unrealistic, but rather emulate common speech errors. The paper further provides empirical evidence of plausibility by conducting a user study with 150 MTurk workers to collect real-world voice command errors. The study confirms that the types of errors generated by LipFuzzer naturally occur, with 38.14% of collected user audio recordings classified as LAPSUS. Examples of these realistic errors are provided, directly demonstrating their plausibility.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section IV-B, \"Weight Training\": \"After we have the initial BN (i.e., a graph with all edge weights set as 1) ready, we further train the weight (i.e., the probabilities of successful transition states) through a user study with audio recording. In this user study, we find sentences or short expressions which contains the states in the models. Then, we ask users in the study to repeat these sentences or expressions... Next, we calculate how many times these transitions are observed.\"\n\nPage 11, Section VI-A, \"Intent Classifier Evaluation\": \"The goal of this experiment is to confirm the existence of LAPSUS in the real world. From the collected audio records, we first remove unqualified audio samples... As a result, 61.86% (193/312) of them are processed with intended skills and functionality. This means that 38.14% of the recorded voice commands are LAPSUS. We showcase examples of these LAPSUS in Table III.\""
