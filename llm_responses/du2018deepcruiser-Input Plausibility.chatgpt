  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility at each mutation step via (1) bounded, conservative transformation parameters so single-step mutations \"sound the same to human beings\", and (2) a rule that prevents repeatedly applying the same type of distortion (volume, speed, clearness) to the same seed. However, it does not guarantee that plausibility is enforced for arbitrary cumulative sequences of mutations across many iterations: the mitigation is rule-based (limiting repeated category changes) and manual checking for low-quality inputs is used (no automated filtering to ensure the final, iteratively-mutated inputs remain within a validated plausible distribution). These properties match the \"Medium\" level: plausibility is constrained between successive mutation steps but cumulative effects across iterations are not fully enforced or automatically validated.",
  "evidence": "Section 6.1 Metamorphic Transformations of Audio Signals (page 12–13): \"we carefully set the parameters to ensure that a single step transformation (on volume, speed or clearness) does not violate the metamorphic relations (i.e., human hearing are not affected); and (2) an audio, generated by mutating from a seed after a sequence of transformations T, is limited to be mutated by a transformation t ∈ S ∪ UAT such that ({t} ∪ S) ∩ T = ∅, where S ∈ {VRT, SRT, CRT}. Intuitively, the constraints make sure that a mutant is generated by altering the volume, speed or clearness of a seed input at most once. If this constraints is unsatisfied, the audio will not be transformed further.\"; Section 7.6 Threats to Validity (page 19): \"We adopt a conservative metamorphic transformation strategy to make small changes on the original audio such that DeepCruiser will generate realistic audio. However, it may still cause false positives especially for the low-quality input ... To mitigate this problem, we manually check and make sure the selected inputs ... are of high quality.\""
