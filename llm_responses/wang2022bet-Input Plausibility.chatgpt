  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility throughout fuzzing iterations by (1) bounding every pixel perturbation to a fixed magnitude ε (they fix |δ_i| = ε) and limiting each byte to only two values (original ± ε), which prevents cumulative drift across iterations, and (2) explicitly using an L∞ constraint (L∞ = 13/255) for all experiments. The mutator logic further ensures that a byte is always one of {Eo[i], Eo[i]±ε} and flips between Eo[i]+ε and Eo[i]-ε rather than accumulating larger deviations. These design choices keep mutated inputs inside a small L∞ ball around the original seed and avoid producing visually implausible / heavily corrupted inputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 166, Section 3.1 (Key Insight): \"For simplicity, we fixate the absolute value of ˆδ_i as ε in BET, and try to find proper signs to maximize Dif.\" \n\nPage 169, Section 3.5 (Mutator): \"...we limit the perturbations to each byte to two choices {+ε, −ε}, where ε is a hyperparameter specific to application scenarios.... Assuming the byte being examined is the i-th byte in the test case if E_b[i] = E_o[i], we randomly add perturbation value of +ε or −ε to this byte. If E_b[i] = E_o[i] − ε, we change this byte to E_o[i] + ε. Otherwise, E_b[i] = E_o[i] + ε must hold and we change this byte to E_o[i] − ε.\" \n\nPage 170, Section 4.1 (Hyperparameters): \"We use the widely used L∞ metric [4] to restrict perturbations for error-inducing inputs on all compared methods.... i.e., L∞ = 13/255 on all datasets (all compared methods use the same setting).\" \n\nPage 172, Section 4.3 (BET for Single Model Testing) (Inact-Rate discussion): \"The Inact-Rate of BET is 0.0%. The perturbations are directly added on pixel values as integers, BET does not suffer the inactivation issue.\""
