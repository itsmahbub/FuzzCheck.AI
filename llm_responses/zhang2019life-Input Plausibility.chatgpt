  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper constrains mutations with linguistically-grounded probabilistic models (LAPSUS Models / Bayesian Networks) trained from real user data, uses a probability cutoff to filter low-likelihood mutations, performs only a single guided mutation per seed template (avoiding multi-step drift), and verifies final inputs by synthesizing realistic speech (Amazon Polly / Google TTS) and testing on real VA devices. These design choices ensure mutated inputs remain plausible within the voice-assistant domain throughout the fuzzing process rather than drifting into unrealistic artifacts.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section 'Our Approach': \"…we input mutated voice commands to VA devices by using machine speech synthesis to eliminate the human factor of producing ASR-related misinterpretation.\"; Page 7-8, Section 'IV.B Linguistic Modeling / Weight Training': \"After we have the initial BN (i.e., a graph with all edge weights set as 1) ready, we further train the weight (i.e., the probabilities of successful transition states) through a user study with audio recording.\"; Page 8, Section 'IV.C Template Fuzzing': \"…we query each LAPSUS Model accordingly using these data. Each query is a path exploration process which returns all reachable states after a starting state. … Note that, during the fuzzing, we only get one mutation for each voice command.\"; Page 9, Section 'V.A Speech Synthesis': \"We use each vApp platforms’ native speech synthesis tools: Amazon Polly [6] and Google Cloud TTS [9].\"; Page 11, Section 'VI.B LipFuzzer Evaluation': \"Figure 7(a) shows that probability cutoff can be used to produce more LAPSUS with lower percentage of ineffective LAPSUS... By applying this cutoff value, we cut off 49.9% of generated LAPSUS population with the effectiveness rate increased to 59.52%.\""
