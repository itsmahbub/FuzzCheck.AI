  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight through both analysis of observable model internals and statistical analysis of failure patterns. First, it establishes a direct statistical correlation between neuron coverage (a model internal) and the model's output (steering angle), demonstrating that changes in internal activations are linked to changes in behavior. Second, it analyzes failure patterns by showing that certain models are more susceptible to failures under specific types of data transformations (e.g., one model failing on 'shear' transformations while others do not). This constitutes a statistical analysis of failure patterns. The paper does not, however, extend this analysis to explain the root cause of these vulnerabilities (e.g., dataset bias, reliance on spurious features), which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5, RQ1: \"Table 5 shows that Spearman correlations for all the models are statistically significant... This result indicates that the neuron coverage changes with the changes in output steering angles, i.e. different neurons get activated for different outputs. Thus, in this setting, neuron coverage can be a good approximation for estimating the diversity of input-output pairs.\" \nPage 10, Section 5, analysis of Table 8: \"Interestingly, some models are more prone to erroneous behaviors for some transformations than others. For example, Rambo produces 23 erroneous cases for shear, while the other two models do not show any such cases. Similarly, DeepTest finds 650 instances of erroneous behavior in Chauffeur for rain but only 64 and 27 for Epoch and Rambo respectively.\""
