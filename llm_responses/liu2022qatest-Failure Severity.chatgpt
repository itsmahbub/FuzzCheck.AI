  "why": "All evidence in the paper shows QATest uncovers robustness errors (mispredictions and inconsistent answers under semantically-preserving transformations) such as wrong spans, irrelevant answers, incorrect <NoAnswer> decisions, and failures to perform reasoning. The authors define a bug as M(q') ≠ M(q) for transformed (semantically consistent) inputs and illustrate detected bug types in a case study (e.g., “<NoAnswer> questions are answered with irrelevant content”, “Answers that are unrelated to the question”, etc.). The paper contains no indication that QATest targets or successfully bypasses explicit safety/policy/security mechanisms, tests safety-aligned or adversarially-defended models, or uncovers high-severity violations like jailbreaks, data leakage, or unauthorized actions. Therefore the failures are best categorized as low-severity (model robustness errors) under the given metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"The experiment results show that the tests generated by QATest detect hundreds of erroneous behaviors of QA systems efficiently.\"; Page 4, Section 3.2 Test Oracle (Definition 3.1): \"A mutant q' ∈ T(q) is regarded as a bug case of M if M(q') ≠ M(q).\"; Page 9, Section 5.4 Answer to RQ4: Case Study: \"we show five types of representative erroneous behaviors... (1) <NoAnswer> questions are answered with irrelevant content... (3) Answers that are unrelated to the question... (5) Answers without logical reasoning.\""
