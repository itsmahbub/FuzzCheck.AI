  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper generates test inputs by applying learned, semantic image-to-image (MUNIT) transformations to produce full synthesized driving images and uses a metamorphic relation (steering-angle consistency) as the oracle. These are coarse, perceptible, semantic-preserving transformations that are less likely to rely on fragile, in-memory floating-point perturbations — which corresponds to the metric's notion that metamorphic transformations provide only partial enforcement of reproducibility. However, the paper does not explicitly reason about or constrain serialization effects (clipping, quantization, file encoding) nor does it state that it enforces that fault-inducing perturbations survive standard I/O; there is no discussion of handling rounding/quantization/clipping during generation or oracle evaluation. Because TACTIC relies on image-level (GAN) synthesis and metamorphic checking (partial robustness) but does not explicitly account for standard I/O serialization effects, the appropriate rating is Medium.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.1 (Environmental Conditions), paper: \"To encode the environmental condition space of an environmental type, we leverage MUNIT, a multimodal unsupervised image-to-image translation framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).\" and \"Then, to produce x2, M recombines the content c1 with a style vector s2 sampled from the style space S2 of X2 by the decoder G2 of X2, i.e., x2 = G2(c1, s2).\" (Section 3.1) ; Section 3.2.2 (Metamorphic Error Analysis), paper: \"Following the existing work (Tian et al., 2018), we also adopt Metamorphic Relation (MR) (Chen et al., 2020) as the test oracle ... the MR is defined as |θo − θt| < ε, where the ε is a user-defined error bound.\" (Section 3.2.2) ; Section 4.2 (Setup/Experiments), paper: \"4 critical environmental conditions are generated ... which are separately applied on the Udacity testing dataset to synthesise testing driving scenes (i.e., 4 × 5614 testing driving scenes are totally generated).\" (Section 4.2) ; — Nowhere in the method or evaluation (Sections 3 and 4) does the paper discuss handling of standard I/O serialization effects (e.g., clipping, quantization, rounding, image file encoding) or constraining perturbations so they explicitly survive serialization during test generation or oracle evaluation."
