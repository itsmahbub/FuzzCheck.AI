  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "DeepCruiser constrains each individual audio mutation to remain plausible (by bounding transformation parameters) and uses a simple rule to prevent repeated category‐level changes (volume, speed, clearness) on a seed. However, it does not automatically enforce that the cumulative effect of multiple allowed transformations stays within a known plausible distribution—there is no distributional filtering or distance checking on the final, iteratively mutated inputs. Instead, plausibility is managed via per-step bounds and a rule‐based cap on how many categories can be applied, plus ad-hoc manual checks. This matches the “Medium” level: plausibility is enforced between successive steps but cumulative drift across the fuzzing iterations is not fully constrained or validated.",
  "evidence": "Section 6.1 (p. 12–13): “we carefully set the parameters to ensure that a single step transformation … does not violate the metamorphic relations …; and … an audio … is limited to be mutated by a transformation t ∈ S ∪ UAT such that ({t} ∪ S) ∩ T = ∅ … Intuitively, the constraints make sure that a mutant is generated by altering the volume, speed or clearness of a seed input at most once.”\nSection 7.6 (p. 19): “To mitigate this problem, we manually check and make sure the selected inputs … are of high quality.”"
