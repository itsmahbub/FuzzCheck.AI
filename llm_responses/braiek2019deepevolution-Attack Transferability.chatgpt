  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly reuses fault-inducing inputs generated by DeepEvolution to detect divergences between an original model and its quantized version (i.e., it reuses generated inputs to test another model variant), but the fuzzing design is not presented as being explicitly aimed at discovering transferable attacks across independently implemented/trained models. The experiments focus on per-dataset single-model instantiations (LeNet for MNIST, CifarNet for CIFAR-10) and compare original vs. quantized versions; they do not evaluate reuse of generated faults across different model implementations trained for the same task nor claim mechanisms specifically for crafting transferable substitute-model attacks.",
  "evidence": "Section III (page 455): \"From one generation of candidates to another, DeepEvolution performs follow-up tests with the resulting transformed inputs and stores the failed tests that exhibit erroneous DNNs behavior or induce a divergence between the original DNN and its quantized version.\" \n\nSection V.D (page 456-457) Findings: \"DeepEvolution can effectively detect defects introduced during DNN quantization, outperforming the coverage-guided fuzzing tool TensorFuzz.\" (Table III reports number of \"difference-inducing inputs\" found for quantization defects.)\n\nExperiment setup (page 456): \"For each dataset (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10), we took, respectively, the official open-source implementation of Tensorflow models, LeNet [3] and CifarNet [4] to allow the reproducibility of our results and comparisons with our approach.\" \n\nRelated work contrast (page 457, Section VII): Paper cites DeepXplore's use of \"multiple DNNs’ implementations\" for differential testing but does not describe performing similar cross-model reuse in DeepEvolution."
