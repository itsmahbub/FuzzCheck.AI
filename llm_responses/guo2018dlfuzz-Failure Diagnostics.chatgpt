  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight based on observable model internals: it adopts and measures neuron coverage, defines a combined optimization objective that explicitly includes neuron activation terms, proposes and evaluates multiple neuron-selection heuristics (frequency, rarity, top weights, near-threshold), and reports experimental correlations between these strategies, increased neuron coverage, and discovery of adversarial inputs (Table 1, Figure 4). However, the analysis stops at these coverage- and activation-level observations and does not link discovered failures to deeper causes such as reliance on non-robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting, nor does it present statistical failure-pattern analyses (e.g., class-level error concentration or input-structure correlations). Therefore the paper meets the criterion for Medium: it analyzes observable internals and failure-finding correlations but does not explain why failures occur in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities.",
  "evidence": "Page 741, Section 3.2 (Algorithm): \"DLFuzz also leverages the same definition and computing way of neuron coverage as DeepXplore [13]. Neurons with output values larger than the set threshold are regarded as activated (covered).\"; Page 741, Section 3.2 (Strategies for Neuron Selection): \"To maximize neuron coverage, we propose four heuristic strategies for selecting neurons... (1) Select neurons covered frequently... (2) Select neurons covered rarely... (3) Select neurons with top weights... (4) Select neurons near the activation threshold.\"; Page 742, Section 4.2 (Result): \"Table 1 presents the effectiveness of DLFuzz compared with DeepXplore. DLFuzz exhibits its advantages in improving neuron coverage... DLFuzz achieves 1.10% to 5.59% higher neuron coverage than DeepXplore...\" and \"We also tried all the proposed neuron selection strategies on two CNNs and depicted the results in Figure 4. All strategies are shown to contribute more to neuron coverage improvement than DeepXplore...\". (These quotes show analysis of observable internals and empirical correlation with failure discovery but there is no text linking failures to non-robust/spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting.)"
