  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper both (1) reuses fault-inducing prompts crafted on one model to test other models (explicit cross-model transfer experiments and reported ASR numbers), and (2) designs the fuzzing/optimization to produce semantically meaningful, lexical-level prompts (hierarchical GA, LLM-based diversification, momentum word scoring) which the authors argue and empirically show improves transfer to black-box models. Thus it demonstrates reuse across models and includes explicit mechanisms intended to discover transferable failures.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability...\"; Page 8, Section 4.2 Results - Transferability: \"We conduct the evaluations by taking the jailbreak prompts with their corresponding requests and targeting another LLM. The results are shown in Tab. 2. AutoDAN exhibits a much better transferability in attacking the black-box LLMs compared with the baseline.\"; Page 8, Table 2 (Cross-model transferability): entries showing transfer ASR (examples) — \"Vicuna-7B -> Guanaco-7b: AutoDAN-HGA ASR 0.7058 Recheck 0.6712\" and \"Llama2-7b-chat -> Vicuna-7B: AutoDAN-HGA ASR 0.7288 Recheck 0.7019\"; Page 8, Table 2 caption / discussion: \"We hypothesize that this is because the AutoDAN generates prompts at a semantic level without relying on direct guidance from gradient information on the tokens, thereby avoiding overfitting on white-box models.\""
