  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method, CUREFUZZ, is designed to uncover 'crash-triggering scenarios' in sequential decision-makers (SDMs). These failures are explicitly defined as catastrophic and unsafe behaviors, such as an autonomous vehicle colliding with pedestrians or a robot falling. This directly aligns with the 'Medium' severity definition, which includes uncovering failures that violate safety expectations and produce unsafe behavior. The paper does not mention testing against models with explicit, separate safety or security mechanisms, nor does it claim to bypass such defenses. Instead, it finds unsafe behaviors inherent in the standard models' learned policies. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'High' but is significantly more severe than 'Low,' which is limited to robustness errors like mispredictions.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2, Approach Overview: \"CUREFUZZ is designed to uncover crash-triggering scenarios that eventually lead to the crash of SDMs. It is crucial to note that the definition of a 'crash' can vary across different environments. For instance, within the context of autonomous driving, a crash could be defined as an incident where an autonomous vehicle collides with pedestrians. In the context of robotics control, a crash can refer to the falling of a walking robot. We employ the term 'crash' to represent its broader conceptual meaning. Furthermore, our methodology focuses on catastrophic failure rather than minor deviations from optimal performance.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.2, Experiment Subject and Environment: \"In CARLA, CUREFUZZ checks for the situations when the SDM-controlled vehicle experiences a collision with other vehicles or buildings.\" and \"In ACAS XU, CUREFUZZ simply aims to find the scenarios when there are collisions between the SDM-controlled airplane with other airplanes.\" and for BipedalWalker, \"We aim to find the scenarios when the robot falls.\""
