  "why": "The paper's proposed method, DeepEvolution, performs untargeted exploration to find generic failures. The system's exploration is driven by a fitness function designed to maximize neuron coverage, which encourages broad exploration of the model's behavior rather than steering it towards a specific, predefined outcome. The types of failures it aims to discover are explicitly stated as general misclassifications and inconsistencies (divergences) between a model and its quantized version. The evaluation focuses on counting the number of any erroneous behaviors (misclassifications) and quantization defects found, without any objective of reaching a specific target label or behavior. This aligns with the definition of untargeted exploration for discovering generic failures.",
  "evidence": "Page 456, Section V.B: 'We define the following fitness function: Fitness = a × NLNC + β × NGNC'. This fitness function is based on maximizing local and global neuron coverage, an untargeted exploration strategy.\n\nPage 457, Section V.C (RQ2 Motivation): 'The objective is to assess the effectiveness of our approach in testing the robustness of the DNN; by finding misclassified synthetic inputs.' This identifies the goal as finding any misclassification, which is a generic failure.\n\nPage 457, Section V.D (RQ3 Motivation): 'The goal is to assess the usefulness of Deep-Evolution in finding difference-inducing inputs that expose potential quantization defects.' This refers to discovering any inconsistency between model versions, another form of generic, untargeted fault discovery."
