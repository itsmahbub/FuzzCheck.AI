  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based method, KuK, to generate test inputs by applying mutations. The primary mutation operators involve adding numerical noise to images. Specifically, the paper mentions \"randomly adding noise to it\" for population initialization and mutating images by \"adding white noise\" during the genetic algorithm's evolution phase. These operations manipulate the in-memory numerical representation of the inputs. The methodology does not describe any steps to account for serialization effects like quantization, rounding, or clipping that would occur when saving these perturbed images to standard file formats (e.g., 8-bit PNG). Consequently, the small, fault-inducing numerical perturbations are likely fragile and may not be reproducible after standard I/O operations, which aligns with the definition for a 'Low' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4, \"UNCOMMON DATA GENERATION\": \"Population Initialization. Given an input image, we first generate a set of images by randomly adding noise to it. In order to generate high-quality images (i.e., recognizable by human), we abandon the affine transformation (e.g., translation and rotation [55]) as the crossover may generate invalid images. We use L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed and its generated counterpart.\"\n\nPage 9, Section 4, \"UNCOMMON DATA GENERATION\": \"Crossover and Mutation. ... After the crossover, each image is randomly mutated by adding white noise, to increase the diversity of the population.\""
