  "why": "The paper presents ADAPT, a white-box testing technique whose primary objective is to maximize neuron coverage metrics. The method generates new inputs by calculating gradients of internal neurons to increase their activation values, with the goal of exploring new internal states of the network. The discovery of adversarial inputs, which the paper evaluates as generic misclassifications, is a consequence of this coverage-guided exploration rather than the result of steering the search towards a predefined, specific output label or a broader class of security-violating behaviors. The entire process is designed for untargeted exploration to find any fault.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section 2.3 White-Box Testing of Neural Networks: \"One of the main goals of neural network testing is to generate test cases (i.e. input vectors) that maximize a given coverage metric (Cov) in a limited testing budget.\" \n\nPage 5, Algorithm 2: The condition for accepting a new test input is based on whether it increases coverage: \"if Cov(O') ⊄ C ∧ Constraint(I, I') then W ← W ∪ {I'}; C ← C ∪ Cov(O')\". This shows the exploration is guided by covering new neurons, not by reaching a target output. \n\nPage 9, Section 4.3 Adversarial Inputs: The evaluation measures the effectiveness in finding generic misclassifications, not targeted ones. \"Table 3 reports the average number of mutations per image (Mutations), the average number of adversarial inputs found per image (Adv. Inputs), the total number of incorrectly classified labels (Labels)...\" This confirms the adversarial discovery is untargeted."
