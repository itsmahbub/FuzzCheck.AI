  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight based on observable model internals: it defines and uses neuron-coverage measures (local and global) and a coverage-based fitness function, reports how generated inputs increase these coverage measures (Table I), and links increases in coverage to the discovery of erroneous behaviors (Section V, RQ1–RQ2). However, it does not perform deeper diagnostic analyses that explain why failures occur in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities (e.g., reliance on spurious/non-robust features, dataset bias, or overfitting), nor does it analyze neuron characteristics beyond coverage (activation frequency, specific layer/position contributions) or present class-level/statistical failure pattern analyses that would support a “High” rating.",
  "evidence": "Section IV.B (page 455) defines the internals-based signals and fitness: \"We adapt the Neuron Coverage (NC) metric proposed by Pei et al. [9] to capture two levels of coverage (i.e., local and global) for each test input... Local neurons coverage (NLNC)... Global neurons coverage (NGNC)... We define the following fitness function: Fitness = α × NLNC + β × NGNC (1)\". Section V.B (page 456) reports coverage gains: \"DeepEvolution significantly boosts the neuronal coverage. Table I shows the final neuronal coverage ratio achieved by each implemented swarm-based metaheuristic.\" Section V.C (pages 456-457) links coverage to failures: \"DeepEvolution can effectively generate test cases that trigger erroneous behaviors of the DNN... This result suggests that DeepEvolution is capable of obtaining adversarial inputs for each original input and that the local coverage level integrated in the fitness function plays an important role in assessing how much the DNN’s state of the transformed input is different from the state that resulted from the original input.\" (Section titles: IV.B \"DNN Coverage\", V.B \"RQ1: DNN Coverage Increase\", V.C \"RQ2: Detection of DNN Erroneous Behaviors\")"
