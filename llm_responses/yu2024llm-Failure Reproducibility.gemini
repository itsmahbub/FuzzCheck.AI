  "why": "The method proposed in the paper, LLM-Fuzzer, operates entirely on textual data. The mutation operators generate new jailbreak templates by using a large language model to modify existing text templates. The resulting test cases are text prompts, which are an inherently serialized format. The metric definition explicitly states: 'We also consider fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., synthesized speech, rendered images, or generated text) as reproducible under this metric, since such inputs are inherently stable with respect to standard I/O operations.' LLM-Fuzzer's approach of generating text-based inputs perfectly aligns with this condition. Unlike numerical perturbations in image or audio data that can be lost through quantization or rounding, the textual perturbations generated by LLM-Fuzzer are perfectly preserved during standard I/O operations (e.g., saving to a file), ensuring failure reproducibility.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 3.3, Mutation: The paper describes its mutation operators as text-to-text transformations performed by an LLM. For instance: 'Generate: This mutation operator employs an LLM by providing it with a template and instructing the model to generate a new template in a similar style but with different content.' The other operators (Crossover, Expand, Shorten, Rephrase) are also described as manipulating text. This confirms that the test cases are generated directly in their final, serialized text format."
