{
  "value": "High",
  "why": "DLFuzz actively enforces plausibility at every fuzzing iteration by bounding the L2 distance of each mutated input to the original seed (Algorithm 1, lines 15–16), preventing cumulative drift. Furthermore, the authors conducted a full manual validation of all 366 adversarial examples, reporting that none changed their semantic identity and that all perturbations remained imperceptible. This combination of a global perturbation constraint and explicit human evaluation of the final fault-inducing inputs satisfies the criteria for a “High” rating.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2, Algorithm 1 (page 741): “l2_distance = distance(x′, x) // measure the perturbation” and “D Lfuzz limits our desired distance to a relatively small range (less than 0.02) to ensure the imperceptibility.”\n\nSection 4.3, Discussion (page 742): “For confirmation, we checked all the 366 adversarial inputs generated by DLFuzz… We haven’t found any adversarial inputs that have already changed their identities after mutation. The adversarial inputs are nearly the same as the original input, and the perturbations are imperceptible.”"
