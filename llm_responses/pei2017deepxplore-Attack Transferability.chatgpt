  "why": "The paper's testing approach is explicitly differential: it requires whitebox access to multiple DNNs and constructs inputs by optimizing across those models so that they disagree. DeepXplore does not present or evaluate the scenario where fault-inducing inputs are crafted on a single surrogate model and then reused (without access) to trigger failures in other, unseen target models. In other words, the paper demonstrates generating inputs that cause differences among available models, but it does not demonstrate or measure transferability of fault-inducing inputs from one model to other independent/unknown models (the kind of surrogate-model transfer evaluated by the metric).",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking.\"; Page 5, Section 3 (Overview): \"DeepXplore takes unlabeled test inputs as seeds and generates new tests that cover a large number of neurons ... while causing the tested DNNs to behave differently.\"; Page 6, Section 4.2 / Algorithm 1: algorithm inputs show \"dnns ← multiple DNNs under test\" and the algorithm selects \"d = randomly select one dnn from dnns\" (showing the method relies on multiple available models during generation); Page 14, Section 8 (Limitations): \"First, differential testing requires at least two different DNNs with the same functionality. Further, if two DNNs only differ slightly ... DeepXplore will take longer to find difference-inducing inputs...\" (stating the necessity of multiple models and acknowledging that DeepXplore cannot operate in the single-surrogate transfer scenario)."
