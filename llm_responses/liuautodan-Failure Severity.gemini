  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper introduces AutoDAN, a method specifically designed to generate 'stealthy jailbreak prompts' for 'aligned Large Language Models (LLMs)'. Aligned LLMs are models equipped with explicit safety mechanisms to prevent them from producing harmful or malicious content. A jailbreak, by definition, is an attack that bypasses these safety features. The paper explicitly evaluates AutoDAN's ability to bypass a defense mechanism, demonstrating its effectiveness against perplexity-based defenses where a baseline attack's effectiveness is significantly reduced. This directly aligns with the 'High' severity metric, as the method's primary goal and demonstrated capability is to uncover high-impact failures (producing forbidden content) by bypassing explicit safety and policy mechanisms in safety-aligned models.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: '...jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that should not be given by aligned LLMs. ... Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.'\n\nPage 1, Introduction: '...jailbreak attacks have been discovered: combining the jailbreak prompt with malicious questions (e.g., how to steal someone’s identity) can mislead the aligned LLMs to bypass the safety feature and consequently generate responses that compose harmful, discriminatory, violent, or sensitive content...'\n\nPage 8, Table 3 Caption: 'Effectiveness against perplexity defense. The results indicate that our method adeptly bypasses this type of defense, whereas GCG attack exhibits a substantial reduction in its attack strength. The evaluation highlights the importance of the preserving semantic meaningfulness of jailbreak prompts when confronting with defenses.'"
