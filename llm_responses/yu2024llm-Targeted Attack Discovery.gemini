  "why": "The paper's proposed method, LLM-Fuzzer, is designed to discover 'jailbreaks' in Large Language Models. The goal is not to elicit a specific, predefined output string from the model, but rather to find inputs that cause the model to generate responses belonging to a broad class of security-violating behaviors, such as 'unlawful, biased, or inappropriate content.' The fuzzer's exploration is guided by an oracle that assesses whether a model's response is 'harmful.' This oracle, a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, is trained to classify responses based on their harmfulness, rewarding the fuzzer for any successful jailbreak, regardless of the specific content. This approach directly aligns with the 'Medium' category, which involves the discovery of broader classes of security-violating behaviors rather than specific, targeted outputs or untargeted exploration.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.1, Technical Overview and Challenges: 'The oracle is responsible for identifying whether a response contains harmful content. If the oracle identifies a response as harmful, LLM-FUZZER retains the template and adds it back to the seed pool.'\n\nPage 8, Section 3.4, Oracle: 'To achieve a balance between cost and accuracy, we developed our own oracle for assessing the harmfulness of responses in our work. We began by using a substantial corpus of responses to unethical questions, meticulously annotating them with labels denoting their harmfulness or non-harmful nature. Subsequently, we harnessed these annotated responses to fine-tune a RoBERTa model [35]. In the context of our research, this RoBERTa model serves as our designated “oracle”.'\n\nPage 2, Abstract: 'The jailbreak threat poses a significant concern for Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily due to their potential to generate content at scale. If not properly controlled, LLMs can be exploited to produce undesirable, offensive content, and other forms of harmful or unethical behavior.'"
