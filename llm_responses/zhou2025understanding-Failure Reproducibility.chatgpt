  "why": "The paper studies coverage criteria and jailbreak detection for LLMs using textual prompts, tokenization, hidden-state inspection, and prompt-generation (paraphrasing/attack-suffix) techniques. It does not discuss applying fine-grained numeric mutations to floating-point input tensors nor does it account for standard I/O serialization effects (clipping, quantization, rounding) during test generation or oracle evaluation. Because the design and evaluation focus on discrete text prompts and internal activations without any explicit handling or constraints to ensure persistence of fault-inducing perturbations under serialization, the work ignores I/O effects relevant to the Failure Reproducibility metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 731, Section II-A (Model Inference Process): \"The text is tokenized into discrete elements, each mapped to a dense embedding vector representing token semantics for further processing by the model.\" \n\nPage 732, Section III-A (Motivation: A Cluster Analysis Experiment): \"We extract the hidden states h from the 4th, 9th, 16th, and 31st transformer blocks for these types of queries and conduct k-means clustering [40].\" \n\nPage 734, Section IV-A(2) (Test Suite Construction / Synonymous Query Dataset): \"To construct synonymous queries, we use GPT-4 to generate corresponding synonymous paraphrases for the first 500 queries from the Alpaca-gpt4 dataset...\" \n\nPage 732, Section III-A (Attack query generation): \"Attack queries are generated by appending adversarial suffixes to rejected queries using GCG [7].\" \n\n(Throughout the paper there is no mention of handling serialization, quantization, clipping, or other I/O effects when generating inputs or when evaluating whether an input induces a failure.)"
