  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper demonstrates that DeepXplore uncovers failures that violate user intent and safety expectations — e.g., it finds inputs that cause self-driving models to make dangerous steering decisions (\"crashing into guard rails\") and causes malware detectors to misclassify malicious files as benign — which are high-impact in real-world terms. However, the paper does not claim or demonstrate that DeepXplore specifically bypasses explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms in defended or safety-aligned models (e.g., adversarially-trained or policy-enforced systems), nor does it claim to induce jailbreaks, data leakage, or unauthorized actions by circumventing explicit defenses. Moreover, the authors explicitly note limitations of differential testing (it requires multiple models and cannot find failures if all models make the same mistake), indicating the method is not presented as a technique for bypassing explicit safeguards. Thus the failures exposed match the metric's description for Medium severity (unsafe/undesired behaviors without demonstrated bypassing of explicit defenses).",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models...\"; Page 11, Section 7 / Table 3 caption: \"The features added to the manifest file by DeepXplore for generating two sample malware inputs which Android app classifiers (Drebin) incorrectly mark as benign.\"; Page 14, Section 8 Limitations: \"First, differential testing requires at least two different DNNs with the same functionality... Second, differential testing can only detect an erroneous behavior if at least one DNN produces different results than other DNNs. If all the tested DNNs make the same mistake, DeepXplore cannot generate the corresponding test case.\"; Page 1, Introduction: \"In safety- and security-critical settings, such incorrect behaviors can lead to disastrous consequences such as a fatal collision of a self-driving car.\""
