  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The DeepXplore paper explicitly enforces domain-specific constraints that prevent out-of-range or non-integer feature values (e.g., clipping pixel values to [0,255] and rounding discrete features), which partially addresses I/O effects such as clipping/quantization. However, the paper does not describe explicit handling or verification of common serialization/encoding effects (e.g., saving as PNG/JPEG or re-loading compressed formats) nor does it state that generated tests are serialized and re-evaluated through typical I/O pipelines before deciding a failure. Thus DeepXplore partially considers serialization effects (clipping/discretization) but does not fully account for I/O/encoding effects during both generation and oracle evaluation, matching the “Medium” level in the metric definition.",
  "evidence": "Section 3 (Overview) — page 5: “We further add domain-specific constraints (e.g., ensure the pixel values are integers within 0 and 255 for image input) to make sure that the modified inputs still represent real-world images.”; Section 4.2 (Domain-specific constraints) — page 9: “For discrete features, we round the gradient to an integer. For DNNs handling visual input (e.g., images), we add different spatial restrictions ... we only allow the pixel values to be decreased.”; Algorithm 1 / Section 4.2 — page 6: the oracle check uses model predictions in memory (pseudo-code): “if d.predict(x) != (dnns-d).predict(x) then gen_test.add(x)”, indicating failures are detected from in-memory model outputs rather than from inputs re-serialized and re-loaded through standard I/O pipelines. (No text in the paper describes explicit serialization/encoding and re-evaluation steps such as saving to PNG/JPEG/WAV and confirming failures persist.)"
