  "why": "The TACTIC method searches the style (environmental-condition) space to maximise detection of erroneous behaviours defined broadly (coverage increase and steering-angle divergence), not to steer the model to a specific, attacker-chosen output. Its fitness objective combines (1) coverage-based diversity and (2) mean steering-angle divergence (Fd), and the oracle is a metamorphic relation that flags large steering-angle divergences. Thus TACTIC intentionally discovers broader classes of unsafe/erroneous behaviours (e.g., large deviations in steering under critical environmental conditions) rather than producing a predefined target output (a specific steering value or explicit attacker-chosen command).",
  "evidence": "Section 3 (The TACTIC Approach), p.3: \"Then TACTIC sets a search objective which is to maximise the number and diversity of erroneous behaviours and employs a search-based method, e.g., (1+1) Evolution Strategy (ES)... to identify the critical environmental conditions.\"; Section 3.2.2 (Metamorphic Error Analysis), p.4: \"the MR used in TACTIC is defined as that the steering angles should be consistent among the driving scenes transformed from the same ones by applying different style vectors... the MR is further relaxed to a steering angle divergence within an error bound.\"; Section 3.2.3 (Fitness Function Definition), p.4: \"The ability to detect diverse erroneous behaviours ... Fc(s) ... The ability to detect more erroneous behaviours ... Fd(s) = 1/|Io| sum_{x in Io} |f(x) - f(g(x,s))| ... F(s) = wc * Fc(s) + wd * norm(Fd(s)).\" These quotes show TACTIC aims to find broadly unsafe behaviours (coverage increases and steering divergences) rather than to induce a specific attacker-chosen output."
