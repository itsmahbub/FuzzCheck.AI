  "why": "The paper describes a differential testing tool that generates the same TTS-produced inputs and feeds them to multiple ASRs for cross-referencing (so inputs are evaluated across ASRs concurrently), but it does not evaluate or claim that fault-inducing inputs discovered on one model are reused to test transferability to other (unseen) models, nor does it include experiments that measure cross-model transfer of faults or support surrogate-model attacks. The evaluation focuses on counting failed test cases per SUT and on how adding more ASRs or changing estimator/visibility affects the number of failures found, without demonstrating or measuring whether inputs that fail one model also cause failures in other models beyond the concurrent cross-referencing setup or in unseen targets.",
  "evidence": "Page 1576, Section 2.1 Workflow: \"we use all ASR systems (including the System Under Test (SUT)) to convert the audio files back to texts (Line 11), and then we perform cross-reference (Line 12). For a piece of audio and its corresponding transcription, there are three possible situations: ... 2) If the SUT fails to recognize the audio file successfully, but at least one of the other ASR systems succeeds, we take this audio file (and the corresponding input text) as a failed test case for the SUT.\"  Page 1577, Section 3 RQ1 and Table 1: RQ1 is \"How many failed test cases can CrossASR++ find?\" and results report counts of failed test cases per SUT under different configurations (no analysis of reuse/transfer to unseen models).  Page 1577, Section 3 RQ2 / Table 2: \"By simply adding one more ASR for cross-referencing, we can increase the number of failed test cases uncovered for 4 SUTs by 25.07%, 39.63%, 20.95% and 8.17% respectively.\" (shows cross-referencing effect but not a transferability experiment).  Page 1578, Conclusion: \"CrossASR++ , an extensible tool that performs black-box differential testing on ASR systems... The extensibility allows CrossASR++ to flexibly utilizes more tools to boost its performance on uncovering failed test cases.\" (no mention of evaluating or supporting transferable/substitute-model attacks)."
