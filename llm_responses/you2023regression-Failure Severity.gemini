  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper defines a 'regression fault' as an input that was correctly predicted by a prior model version (M1) but is incorrectly predicted by the subsequent version (M2). This aligns directly with the metric's definition of 'Low' severity, as it constitutes a model robustness error, specifically a prediction inconsistency resulting from model evolution. The paper's entire methodology and evaluation framework are built around finding and counting these mispredictions. There is no mention or analysis of uncovering unsafe behaviors (like toxicity or bias) or bypassing explicit safety or security mechanisms.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section II. DEFINITION, Definition 2. Regression fault: \"Given a prior version model M1, its regression model M2, a test input x, and its ground truth label y, x is called to trigger a regression fault if x is correctly predicted by M1, yet wrongly predicted by M2, i.e., c_M1[x] = y ^ c_M2[x] != y.\""
