  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility using rule-based constraints. It defines a set of image transformations (rotation, translation, shear, zoom, brightness, contrast) intended to simulate 'natural environmental variations' and restricts the parameters of these transformations to bounded ranges to ensure the resulting images are 'visually similar to natural ones'. Crucially, the method is designed to prevent the cumulative effect of mutations across iterations, which could lead to unrealistic inputs. It achieves this by always applying transformations to the original seed image, not to an already-mutated one. However, the paper does not provide any empirical validation that the final augmented inputs are perceptually realistic, such as through a human study or by using quantitative metrics like SSIM or LPIPS. The plausibility is asserted based on the design constraints rather than being empirically verified, which prevents a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.3.2, 'Generation of population': 'Furthermore, SENSEI always applies the resulting transformation vector (chromosome) on the original image (as opposed to applying on an already transformed data) to prevent the resulting data from being unrealistic.' \nPage 7, Section 4.2, 'Generation of Realistic Variations': 'SENSEI focuses on improving the robustness of DNN models by augmenting training data with natural environmental variations. ... To make sure the translated images are visually similar to natural ones, we restrict the space of allowed perturbations... The operations and corresponding restrictions with respect to an image x are as follows: • rotation(x,d): rotate x by d degree within a range [-30, 30]. • translation(x, d): horizontally or vertically translate x by d pixels within a range of [-10%, 10%] of image size. ... These image operations preserve the content of original image.'"
