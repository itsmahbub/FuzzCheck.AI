  "why": "The paper defines and evaluates regression-fault-triggering inputs strictly with respect to a prior model M1 and its regression model M2 (i.e., it detects inputs where M1 is correct and M2 is incorrect). All described generation, fidelity filtering, and evaluation steps execute mutated inputs on that M1–M2 pair. The experiments use multiple dataset/model pairs but do not evaluate whether inputs found on one model transfer to other models performing the same task, nor does the design include explicit mechanisms to discover or measure transferable attacks across different model implementations. Therefore the paper does not demonstrate attack transferability as defined by the metric.",
  "evidence": "Section II (Definition), Definition 2 — \"Given a prior version model M1, its regression model M2, a test input x, and its ground truth label y, x is called to trigger a regression fault if x is correctly predicted by M1, yet wrongly predicted by M2, i.e., cM1[x] = y ∧ cM2[x] ≠ y.\" (Section II, Definition 2)\n\nSection III (Approach) — \"the mutated inputs are passed into the GAN-based Fidelity Assurance model ... The inputs that do not trigger regression faults will be maintained ... the mutated inputs ... are then executed by both the original model and the regression model. If the two models provide different prediction results, then a regression-fault-triggering input is identified.\" (Section III, overview / Approach)\n\nSection IV-A1 (Subjects / Experimental setup) — \"we used four pairs of datasets and DNN models as subjects, i.e., LeNet-5 on MNIST, VGG16 on CIFAR10, AlexNet on Fashion-MNIST (FM), and ResNet18 on SVHN\" (Section IV-A1 Subjects). \n\nThroughout the paper (Approach and Evaluation sections) all testing and analysis focus on M1 vs. M2 pairs; there is no experiment or statement reusing inputs crafted on one model to test different, unseen target models nor any mechanism intended to discover transferable attacks across model implementations."
