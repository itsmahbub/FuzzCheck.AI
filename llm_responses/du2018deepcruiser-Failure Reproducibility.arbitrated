  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The DeepCruiser framework relies on semantic‐preserving, metamorphic transformations of audio inputs (e.g., volume, speed, noise adjustments) which inherently introduce coarse‐grained perturbations that are likely robust to standard I/O quantization. However, the paper does not explicitly account for serialization effects (rounding, clipping, quantization) when writing or reading audio in common formats, nor does it constrain mutations to guarantee that fault‐inducing perturbations survive such operations. According to the metric definition, approaches using metamorphic transformation without explicit handling of I/O effects receive a “Medium” rating, reflecting partial enforcement of failure reproducibility.",
  "evidence": "Section 6.1 describes the set of metamorphic transformations on audio (ChangeVolume, LowPassFilter, PitchShift, etc.) applied directly in memory to preserve human‐perceived semantics, but makes no mention of an explicit save/load cycle or quantization/clipping safeguards; Section 6.2 (Algorithm 1) shows mutation and oracle evaluation steps operating solely on in‐memory audio without serialization."
