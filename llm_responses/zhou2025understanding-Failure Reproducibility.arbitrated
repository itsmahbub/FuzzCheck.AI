  "value": "High",
  "why": "All of the paper’s test generation and evaluation is performed in the textual domain: inputs are discrete text prompts that are paraphrased, attacked via suffixes, or rewritten by GPT-4. Text is inherently a serialized format not subject to quantization, clipping or rounding losses. According to the Failure Reproducibility metric, fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (including text) are deemed fully reproducible under standard I/O operations. Therefore, the faults induced by these adversarial text prompts will persist unchanged through any standard serialization/deserialization pipeline.",
  "evidence": "Page 731, Section III-A: “Attack queries are generated by appending adversarial suffixes to rejected queries using GCG [7].”\nPage 734, Section IV-A(2): “To construct synonymous queries, we use GPT-4 to generate corresponding synonymous paraphrases for the first 500 queries from the Alpaca-gpt4 dataset…”\nPage 738, Section V-C: “Over five iterations, GPT-4 generates ten new jailbreak queries per round through prompt rewriting.”\n(At no point does the paper apply fine-grained floating-point mutations or consider clipping, rounding, or quantization—inputs remain plain text.)"
