  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly targets aligned/safety-trained LLMs and demonstrates that AutoDAN generates jailbreak prompts that cause those models to produce undesired/harmful outputs and to bypass explicit defenses. The authors state the attack goal as disrupting human-aligned refusals, evaluate on aligned models (e.g., Llama2-7b-chat) and show high attack success rates even when a perplexity-based defense is applied. They also report successful transfers to commercial models (e.g., GPT-3.5) in black-box settings. These points indicate AutoDAN uncovers high-impact failures that bypass alignment and safety mechanisms, matching the metric's definition of 'High.'",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"AutoDAN: ... generating stealthy jailbreak prompts on aligned large language models\" and \"we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.\" \n\nPage 3, Section 3.1 PRELIMINARIES (Threat model): \"The main goal of this type of attack is to disrupt the human-aligned values of LLMs or other constraints imposed by the model developer, compelling them to respond to malicious questions posed by adversaries with correct answers, rather than refusing to answer.\" \n\nPage 7, Section 4.2 RESULTS (Effectiveness against defense): \"As demonstrated in Tab. 3, the perplexity defense significantly undermines the effectiveness of the token-level jailbreak attack, i.e., GCG attack. However, the semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts AutoDAN (and the original handcrafted DAN) is not influenced.\" (Table 3 shows AutoDAN-HGA achieving high ASR on Llama2-7b-chat even under perplexity defense.)"
