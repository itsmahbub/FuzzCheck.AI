  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method, MDPFuzz, is designed to maintain the realism of test inputs, which are state sequences in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It achieves this by exclusively mutating the initial state of a sequence, arguing this preserves the natural temporal coherence of subsequent states generated by the environment's dynamics. Crucially, every mutated initial state undergoes an explicit, automated validation step to ensure it is both plausible and solvable within the task domain. For instance, in the CARLA driving simulator, it relies on the simulator's built-in validation to reject abnormal states, and for the ACAS Xu aircraft collision system, it applies domain-specific constraints like speed limits. This systematic validation of the inputs that trigger failure sequences fulfills a key requirement of the metric. However, the paper does not meet the 'High' criteria because it lacks an independent, empirical evaluation (e.g., a human study or quantitative perceptual metrics) to confirm the realism of the fault-inducing initial states; it only claims they are realistic because they pass the environment's validation checks.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 6, 'MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation': 'All the mutated states are validated in an automated and deliberate way (see below). That is, we confirm that all mutated states are valid and solvable.'\n\nPage 6, Section 4, 'Design Overview': 'Moreover, we only mutate the initial state rather than arbitrary states to generate more realistic scenarios... For each MDP scenario, we validate mutated initial states in a deliberate way to ensure they are realistic and solvable for an optimal model π*.'\n\nPage 9, Section 6, 'MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation': 'Particularly, in CARLA, we change the initial positions and angles of all 100 vehicles... Note that CARLA validates and rejects abnormal initial states: all mutated initial states passed its validation... In DNN-based ACAS Xu, we mutate the initial positions and speeds... Moreover, we bound the maximal speed of all airplanes below 1,100 ft/sec, which is within the range of normal speed... We guarantee that there exist optimal actions to avoid the crash and solve the initial states, and we do not use an initial state that is not solvable.'"
