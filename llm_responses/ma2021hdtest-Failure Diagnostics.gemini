  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by conducting a statistical analysis of failure patterns. Specifically, in the 'Per-class Analysis' section, the authors examine the difficulty of generating adversarial examples (failures) for each digit class in the MNIST dataset. They observe and attempt to explain correlations between the input data's characteristics (visual similarity between digits) and the fuzzing effort required to induce a failure. For example, they note that the digit '1' is harder to generate adversarial examples for, attributing this to its visual dissimilarity from other digits. Conversely, they find it easier for the digit '9' and hypothesize this is due to its visual similarity to '8' and '3'. This analysis of class-level error concentration and its correlation with input structure qualifies for a 'Medium' rating. The analysis does not, however, extend to explaining why these failures occur by linking them to underlying model vulnerabilities like non-robust features or overfitting, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS, C. Per-class Analysis: 'We then perform a per-class analysis on L1/L2 distance and fuzzing iterations as shown in Fig. 7. We can observe that for some classes such as “1”, the average fuzzing iteration is drastically higher, which means that it is relatively difficult to generate adversarial examples. For other classes such as “9”, the average fuzzing iteration is lower. This is reasonable because all the other digits except for “7” are visually dissimilar from “1” while “9” has quite a few similarities such as “8” and “3”.'"
