  "why": "The method generates test inputs by synthesizing audio from a text corpus using standard Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines. This design inherently constrains the inputs to be plausible speech, as TTS systems are designed to produce human-like utterances. This serves as a strong, rule-based constraint that enforces input plausibility in the generation step. However, the paper does not provide any empirical validation, either through human studies or quantitative metrics (e.g., PESQ, STOI), to confirm that the final, failure-inducing audio inputs are realistic and intelligible. The paper acknowledges that TTS can produce 'invalid audios,' but these are filtered out as 'indeterminable test cases' based on consensus among ASR systems, not by a direct assessment of plausibility. This approach fits the 'Medium' criteria, as it enforces plausibility during generation but does not empirically validate the final outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section 2.1, Workflow: 'Then, TTS is used to generate an audio file for each piece of selected text (Line 9)... If all the ASR systems cannot recognize the audio correctly, we call it an indeterminable test case because a TTS may generate an invalid audio.' This shows the method of generation (TTS) and the indirect way of handling potentially implausible ('invalid') inputs. The Experiments section (Section 3) evaluates the method based on the number of failed test cases found, without reporting any measures of the audio inputs' realism or quality."
