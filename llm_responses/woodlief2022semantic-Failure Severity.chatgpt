  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's semantic-fuzzing approach (semSensFuzz / semImFuzz) uncovers misinterpretations and undesirable perception outputs (e.g., objects misclassified after semantic additions or occlusions) that violate safety expectations for autonomous systems. The authors report many significant and extreme semantic failures (misclassifications caused by added cars/people) that could be safety-relevant. However, the work targets standard perception models and semantic mutations (add car, add pedestrian, change color) and does not demonstrate bypassing explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms (e.g., attacking defended or safety-aligned models, inducing data leakage or unauthorized actions). Therefore the failures exposed are beyond simple low-level robustness errors but do not meet the paper’s or the metric’s definition of high severity (bypassing explicit defenses), placing the method in the Medium category.",
  "evidence": "Page 1958, Abstract: \"we found that it synthesized tests with novel and subjectively realistic image inputs, and that it discovered inputs that revealed significant inconsistencies between the specified and computed interpretations.\" (Abstract) \n\nPage 1966, Section 6.4.1 (RQ1 Results): \"1210 SUT inconsistencies resulting from 884 mutations and that each SUT had over 100 inconsistencies. Further, each of the SUTs exhibited at least one significant inconsistency and 3 of the 5 SUTs combined to exhibit a total of 20 extreme inconsistencies.\" (Section 6.4.1) \n\nPage 1966, Figure 12 caption / discussion: \"The rightmost column shows an extreme inconsistency; an added car occludes a truck, causing EfficientPS to misclassify the truck, labelling portions as 'do not care' and the rest as building.\" (Section 6.4.1, example of semantic misclassification) \n\nPage 1961, Section 4.1: \"we created an extensible pipeline in Python for fuzzing perception systems of autonomous vehicles with a single front-facing camera, semImFuzz, that implements three mutations: changing the color of cars, adding cars, and adding pedestrians.\" (Section 4.1) \n\nPage 1965, Section 6.1 (SUTs): \"we evaluate it on five highly competitive perception systems submitted to the Cityscapes benchmark...\" (Section 6.1) — showing the evaluation targets are standard benchmark SUTs rather than defended or safety-aligned models."
