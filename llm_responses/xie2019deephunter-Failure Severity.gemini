  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper defines and evaluates failures strictly as model robustness errors, specifically prediction inconsistencies under semantically preserving input mutations. The core test oracle, as defined in the paper, identifies an 'erroneous behavior' when a model's prediction on a mutated input differs from its correct prediction on the original input. This aligns perfectly with the 'Low' severity definition. The experimental evaluation is conducted on standard image classification benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet), and the 'errors' or 'defects' counted are misclassifications. The paper does not discuss or evaluate the fuzzer's ability to uncover unsafe behaviors (Medium) or to bypass any explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms (High).",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2.1, \"Definition 2. Given a DNN F, a human oracle O, a metamorphic mutation strategy M and a test x satisfying F(x) = O(x), a mutant x' ∈ M(x) is an erroneous behavior of F if F(x') ≠ F(x).\""
