  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs and applies bounded, rule-based metamorphic transformations for audio (Section 6.1) and enforces constraints to limit accumulation of major distortions across mutation steps (e.g., altering volume, speed or clearness at most once). This shows the authors attempt to enforce input plausibility during mutation. However, they do not provide a systematic empirical assessment (human study or task-specific perceptual/fluency metrics such as PESQ/STOI/Perplexity/LPIPS/SSIM) to demonstrate that the final fault-inducing inputs remain perceptually/semantically realistic. The only explicit plausibility validation reported is a manual check of selected (100) high-quality seed inputs to mitigate false positives (Threats to Validity), not a broader or quantitative evaluation of final mutants. Therefore the paper enforces plausibility constraints in mutation design but lacks comprehensive validation of plausibility for produced failing inputs, matching the 'Medium' level.",
  "evidence": "Section 6.1 (Metamorphic Transformations of Audio Signals), page 13: \"To generate suitable defect-triggering candidates, we apply the transformations with restraints to ensure that the audio seeds and the corresponding mutants sound the same to human beings.\"; Section 6.1 (same), page 13: \"(1) we carefully set the parameters to ensure that a single step transformation (on volume, speed or clearness) does not violate the metamorphic relations ... and (2) an audio, generated by mutating from a seed after a sequence of transformations T, is limited to be mutated by a transformation t ∈ S ∪ UAT such that ({t} ∪ S) ∩ T = ∅, where S ∈ {VRT, SRT, CRT}. Intuitively, the constraints make sure that a mutant is generated by altering the volume, speed or clearness of a seed input at most once. If this constraints is unsatisfied, the audio will not be transformed further.\"; Section 7.6 (Threats to Validity), page 19: \"We adopt a conservative metamorphic transformation strategy to make small changes on the original audio such that DeepCruiser will generate realistic audio. However, it may still cause false positives ... To mitigate this problem, we manually check and make sure the selected inputs (i.e., the 100 audio in RQ1, RQ2, RQ3 and RQ4) are of high quality.\""
