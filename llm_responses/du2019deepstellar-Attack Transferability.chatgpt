  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate whether fault-inducing inputs transfer across different models. All algorithms and experiments are formulated and executed per-target-model (the abstract model M and the RNN D are paired), adversarial examples were generated for particular models only, and the authors explicitly note they could only generate adversarial samples for one DeepSpeech version due to tool compatibility. There are no experiments reusing inputs crafted on one model to test other models performing the same task, nor design elements aimed at discovering transferable attacks.",
  "evidence": "Section 5.1 (page 481): \"input :D: RNN-based DL system, M: Abstract model of D\" and \"We first collect a set of benign samples B and a set of adversarial samples A.\" (Algorithm 1) — shows detection is trained per given RNN and its abstract model. Section 5.2 (page 482): \"input :I: Initial seeds, D: RNN-based DL system, M: Abstract model of D\" (Algorithm 2) — testing is guided against a single RNN instance D with its model M. Section 6.1 Data Preparation (page 483): \"Finally, we only successfully generate adversarial samples for DeepSpeech-0.1.1 because there exists a compatibility issue between DeepSpeech-0.3.0 and the adversarial attack tools [8] we used.\" — indicates adversarial samples were not produced for multiple models and no cross-model reuse/transfer experiments were performed. Section 6.4 (page 485): \"...we trained a classifier for each model to detect adversarial samples.\" — confirms evaluation is per-model, not testing transferability across models."
