  "value": "High",
  "why": "The method enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing iterations by explicitly constraining mutations relative to the original seed input, not just the immediate parent. The algorithm design includes a `Constraint(I, I')` check where `I` is the initial input and `I'` is the newly generated candidate. This directly prevents the cumulative drift that can lead to unrealistic inputs. The experimental setup confirms that this constraint was implemented by maintaining a small L2-distance between the initial and mutated inputs across all tests. The paper further supports this with qualitative evidence, stating that the generated adversarial images for complex datasets were visually indistinguishable from the originals.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.1, Experimental Setup: \"All the techniques, including ADAPT, performed testing while maintaining the L2-distance between the initial and mutated inputs within 0.05 on average.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 4.3, Adversarial Inputs: \"In particular, the adversarial images found for VGG-19 and ResNet-50 were visually indistinguishable from the original ones.\""
