  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper satisfies the criteria for 'Medium' by both enforcing plausibility in individual mutation steps and validating the plausibility of the final generated inputs. Plausibility is enforced by adopting a 'conservative strategy' that constrains image transformations using both L0 and L∞ norms, which aligns with the 'bounded or rule-based constraints' mentioned in the metric definition. However, the paper does not discuss or address the potential for cumulative drift over multiple iterations. Crucially, the authors explicitly validate the plausibility of the final fault-inducing inputs through a large-scale manual investigation (a form of human study), reporting high validity ratios across multiple datasets. This direct assessment of the final outputs clearly meets the 'Medium' criteria. The method does not qualify for 'High' because it does not demonstrate a mechanism to ensure inputs remain within a plausible distribution *throughout* the entire fuzzing process to prevent cumulative drift.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.2, \"Distribution-Guided Test Generation\": \"To guarantee the validity of the generated inputs, we adopt the conservative strategy [63] that constrains the transformation with both L0 and L∞.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 4.2.2, \"RQ2: Efficiency of DistXplore\": \"In order to evaluate the validity of the generated inputs, we conducted a manual investigation by randomly selecting 10,000 erroneous inputs from the testing outputs of each model and calculating the average validity ratio. The validity ratios were found to be 98.5%+, 96.5%+, 98.7%+, and 95.3%+ for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, respectively. The results demonstrate that DistXplore is capable of generating valid inputs with high proportions.\""
