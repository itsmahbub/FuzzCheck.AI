  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper designs mutation operators that explicitly aim to preserve semantic correctness (using LLM-assisted Generate/Crossover/Expand/Shorten/Rephrase operators) and adds a seed-selection reward discount (α * path length) and early-termination probability to discourage deep mutation chains, i.e., mechanisms that constrain individual mutation steps and help limit cumulative drift. However, the paper does not present any empirical assessment of the perceptual or semantic plausibility of the final fault-inducing prompts (no human evaluation or task-specific quantitative measures such as perplexity or semantic-similarity scores are reported). Thus the work enforces plausibility in mutation design and includes measures to reduce accumulation effects, but it does not validate final-input plausibility empirically — matching the \"Medium\" definition.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.3 Mutation (page 4662): \"To maintain the semantic correctness of newly generated prompts, we have introduced five innovative mutation operators that harness LLMs as assistants for prompt alteration while preserving their semantic integrity.\"; Section 3.2 Seed Selection / Algorithm 1 (page 4661): algorithm lines show reward discounting to penalize deep paths: \"if reward > 0 then\\n    reward ← max(reward − α * len(path), β)\" (Algorithm 1, Update); Section 3.3 (page 4662): \"To showcase that the newly generated templates can maintain their semantic integrity and diversify our template collection, Figure 3 presents several post-mutated templates.\" — i.e., qualitative examples only; Section 3.4 Oracle (page 4663): \"we harnessed these annotated responses to fine-tune a RoBERTa model... this RoBERTa model serves as our designated 'oracle'.\" — oracle evaluates harmfulness of outputs, not input plausibility; Section 4.1 Metrics (page 4664): defines evaluation metrics (JQN, ASR, EASR, QBC, TBC) with no mention of human evaluation or quantitative plausibility measures (e.g., perplexity or semantic-similarity), and no human study of final prompts is reported. Together these passages show plausibility is enforced in mutation steps and some controls for accumulation exist, but final-input plausibility is not empirically validated."
