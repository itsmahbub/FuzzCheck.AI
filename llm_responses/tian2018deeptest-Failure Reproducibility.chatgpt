  "why": "DeepTest generates test inputs by applying semantic, metamorphic image transformations (brightness, contrast, affine transforms, blur, rain/fog, etc.) and uses those transformed images as tests. This approach produces coarse, perceptible changes that are likely to survive standard image serialization, and the paper explicitly uses metamorphic relations as the oracle. However, the paper does not explicitly reason about or constrain low-level numerical effects of serialization (quantization, rounding, clipping) nor does it describe steps to ensure that fault-inducing perturbations survive typical I/O formats. Therefore DeepTest partially considers I/O effects via use of semantic image transformations (which tends to improve reproducibility) but does not explicitly enforce or evaluate reproducibility under serialization, matching the definition of the metric's Medium level.",
  "evidence": "Page 306, Section 3.2 (Increasing Coverage with Synthetic Images): \"Therefore, DeepTest focuses on generating realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations on seed images and mimic different real-world phenomena like camera lens distortions, object movements, different weather conditions, etc. To this end, we investigate nine different realistic image transformations (changing brightness, changing contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, blurring, fog effect, and rain effect).\"; Page 307, Section 4 (Implementation) / \"Image transformations\": \"In the experiments for RQ2 and RQ3, we leverage seven different types of simple image transformations: translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, contrast adjustment, brightness adjustment, and blurring. We use OpenCV to implement these transformations [7].\"; Page 307, Section 3.4 (Creating a Test Oracle with Metamorphic Relations): \"The key insight is that even though it is hard to specify the correct behavior of a self-driving car for every transformed image, one can define relationships between the car’s behaviors across certain types of transformations. For example, the autonomous car’s steering angle should not change significantly for the same image under any lighting/weather conditions, blurring, or any affine transformations with small parameter values.\"; Page 311, Section 6 (Threats to Validity): \"While our transformations like rain and fog effects are designed to be realistic, the generated pictures may not be exactly reproducible in reality due to a large number of unpredictable factors, e.g., the position of the sun, the angle and size of the rain drops. etc.\"; Page 304, Introduction (Contributions): \"We have made the erroneous behaviors detected by DeepTest available at https://deeplearningtest.github.io/deepTest/. We also plan to release the generated test images and the source of DeepTest for public use.\""
