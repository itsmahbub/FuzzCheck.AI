  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by performing a statistical analysis of failure patterns. In the case study (RQ4), the authors investigate and classify the erroneous behaviors detected by their framework, QATest, into five distinct types. This classification is based on analyzing the input questions and the incorrect outputs from the Question Answering (QA) system. The bug types identified include '<NoAnswer> questions are answered with irrelevant content', 'Answerable questions are answered with <NoAnswer>', and 'Answers without logical reasoning'. This categorization represents a statistical analysis of failure patterns, which aligns with the 'Medium' criteria. The analysis does not, however, extend to linking these failures to underlying model vulnerabilities (like overfitting or dataset bias) or analyzing observable model internals (like neuron activations), which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section 5.4, Answer to RQ4: Case Study: \"In this RQ, we investigate and classify the erroneous behaviors of the QA system detected by QATest. In Table 6, we show five types of representative erroneous behaviors. ... Specifically, we summarize the bug types below. (1) <NoAnswer> questions are answered with irrelevant content. ... (2) Answerable questions are answered with <NoAnswer>. ... (3) Answers that are unrelated to the question. ... (4) Answers with wrong keywords in the context. ... (5) Answers without logical reasoning.\""
