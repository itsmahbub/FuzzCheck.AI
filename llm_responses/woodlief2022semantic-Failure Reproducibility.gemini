  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method, `semImFuzz`, generates test cases by applying semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations to existing images, such as adding a car or changing an object's color. According to the metric's definition, using such transformations without explicitly enforcing reproducibility under serialization qualifies for a 'Medium' rating. The paper's methodology focuses heavily on ensuring the 'conformity' of the mutated images—that they are visually realistic and physically plausible—through various checks related to perspective, lighting, and object placement. However, the paper does not mention or explicitly account for numerical alterations that can occur during standard I/O operations like saving an image to a file (which involves quantization, rounding, or clipping). The test generation and execution pipeline appears to be conducted entirely in memory, without a step to serialize and then deserialize the mutated input to confirm that the failure-inducing perturbation persists.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.2, Changing Object Color: \"The simplest mutation we implemented changes the color of a single entity in the test case...\".\nPage 6, Section 4.3, Adding an Entity: \"Adding entities to scenes is one of the advances of semImFuzz. The goal of this mutation is to add an entity to a scene in a way that may impact the perception system such as adding a vehicle or pedestrian.\"\nPage 7, Section 4.3.2, Potential for False Positives: This section discusses sources of invalid tests, but focuses on semantic and visual realism issues like perspective mismatches, object overlap, inconsistent lighting, and missing shadows, rather than numerical artifacts lost during I/O operations. For instance: \"Another consideration is consistent lighting... This can lead to nonconforming images, as shown in Figure 9d.\""
