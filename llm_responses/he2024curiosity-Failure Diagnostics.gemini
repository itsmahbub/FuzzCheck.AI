  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight through a statistical analysis of failure patterns. Specifically, it analyzes the spatial distribution of crash-triggering scenarios for one of the experimental subjects (Coop Navi). It visualizes the agent positions in the state space that lead to crashes and observes that a baseline method finds crashes concentrated near the boundary of the valid input space, whereas the proposed method, CUREFUZZ, finds crashes in more widely distributed positions. This constitutes an analysis of failure patterns. However, the paper does not extend this analysis to explain *why* these failures occur by linking them to underlying model vulnerabilities such as overfitting, dataset bias, or reliance on spurious features, which would be necessary for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 5 EXPERIMENT RESULTS, Figure 2 and the related discussion on page 8: 'Recall that the goal of the Coop Navi game is to find the scenarios when the agents collide with each other, in Figure 2, we select the median performance from the five repeated experiments for CUREFUZZ and G-Model, and plot the positions of the agents in the crash-triggering scenarios found by different methods. While the valid range of the agent’s position is from -1 to 1, from Figure 2, we can see that G-Model tends to find the crashes that the agents are positioned around the boundary of the valid input. In contrast, CUREFUZZ covers more spread positions.'"
