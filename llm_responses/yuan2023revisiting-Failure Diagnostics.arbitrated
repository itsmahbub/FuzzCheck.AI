  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "While the paper offers substantial diagnostic insight—leveraging internal layer‐wise signals (variance, covariance, density, shape) to explain coverage behavior, correlating those signals with fault‐revealing capability, and presenting statistical analyses of failure patterns (e.g., class–level diversity, entropy)—it does not systematically trace individual failures back to concrete model vulnerabilities such as reliance on specific non‐robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting. The brief use of stylizing and blurring to probe texture bias cites prior work but does not amount to a principled, per‐failure root‐cause analysis linking failures to underlying vulnerabilities. Therefore, the paper fulfills the ‘Medium’ level of failure diagnostics: it provides internal and statistical analyses but stops short of full explanatory links to deeper model weaknesses.",
  "evidence": "Section IV (p. 1204–1205): design of NLC via variance, covariance, density and shape of layer outputs; Section VI-A2 (p. 1208): statistical correlation of NLC with fault-revealing capability; Section VI-B Diversity of Erroneous Behaviors (p. 1209): use of class cover and scaled entropy; Section VI-B Setup (p. 1209): mentions blurring/stylizing to reveal texture bias but without detailed root-cause analysis."
