  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility using a bounded constraint but does not empirically validate the plausibility of the final generated inputs. The method uses an L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed image and its generated counterparts, with the explicit goal of generating \"high-quality images (i.e., recognizable by human)\". This use of a bounded perturbation is a mechanism to control plausibility. However, the paper provides no empirical assessment to confirm that this goal was achieved. There are no human studies, quantitative perceptual metrics (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS), or even qualitative examples of the final fault-inducing images to demonstrate their realism or semantic validity. This fulfills the criteria for a \"Medium\" rating, as it includes a plausibility enforcement mechanism but lacks the empirical validation of the final outputs required for a \"High\" rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4, \"Population Initialization\": \"In order to generate high-quality images (i.e., recognizable by human), we abandon the affine transformation (e.g., translation and rotation [55]) as the crossover may generate invalid images. We use L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed and its generated counterpart.\"\nPage 9, Section 5.1, \"Setting\": \"For the mutation process, the radius of L∞ is set as 0.3.\""
