  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's KuK fuzzer intentionally generates \"uncommon\" adversarial inputs that explicitly bypass existing adversarial defense mechanisms. The authors evaluate multiple defenses and report that these uncommon inputs reduce defense effectiveness substantially (e.g., large drops in detection/mitigation success, and concrete examples where defenses fail on the uncommon data). Because the method finds inputs that defeat explicit safety/security safeguards (adversarial defenses), it uncovers high-impact failures under the metric definition.",
  "evidence": "Page 740, Introduction / Contributions: \"Our further evaluation reveals that the uncommon data generated by our method is hard to be defended by the existing defense techniques with the average defense success rate reduced by 35%.\" \n\nPage 740, Introduction / Contributions: \"For example, on the model NIN, the uncommon data achieve 97.5% success rate on bypassing the mutation-based defense, while the common data only make it 5.5%.\"\n\nPage 748, Section 5.2 (RQ4) / Answer to RQ4: \"Answer to RQ4: The uncommon data inputs are not well defended by existing defense techniques while the common data are relatively easier to be defended. In particular, the binary classifier and mutation-based detection approaches are less useful in defending the uncommon data inputs (e.g., with only 5% and 10% on NIN and ResNet-20, respectively).\""
