  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly avoids the continuous→discrete inactivation problem by generating perturbations directly on pixel/byte values (integers) and reports an Inact-Rate of 0.0%, which shows they consider discretization/clipping at the byte/pixel level during mutation and oracle evaluation. However, the paper does not explicitly discuss standard I/O serialization effects (e.g., image encoding/decoding, lossy formats, rounding introduced by file formats like JPEG/PNG or audio encoders) or any explicit handling/verification that failures remain after saving/loading inputs via common storage formats. This is a partial (but not full) treatment of serialization: they enforce reproducibility with respect to integer pixel representation and avoid rounding-inversion issues from gradient-based continuous perturbations, but they do not demonstrate explicit handling of file-format quantization/encoding effects. Under the metric definition, this corresponds to a Medium rating.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.1 / p.166: \"Note that BET clearly departs from the white-box testing methods that first rely on gradient-based calculation and then transfer calculated decimals back to integers which may lead to ineffective samples (see inactivation issue in Section 4.3).\" Section 3.5 Mutator / p.169: \"Note each byte has 256 kinds of perturbations. Thus, for input with N pixels, the search space of perturbations is 256^N which is too large to explore efficiently. Instead, we limit the perturbations to each byte to two choices {+ε, −ε}, where ε is a hyperparameter specific to application scenarios.\" Section 4.3 Results (Inact-Rate) / p.172: \"The Inact-Rate of BET is 0.0%. The perturbations are directly added on pixel values as integers, BET does not suffer the inactivation issue.\" Section 4.2 (Differential Testing setup) / p.170: discusses quantized models (8-bit/16-bit) via TensorFlow-Lite (model quantization), but there is no corresponding discussion in the methodology or evaluation about saving inputs to disk or explicitly modelling standard I/O encoding/decoding (PNG/JPEG/etc.) effects that might alter pixel values after serialization."
