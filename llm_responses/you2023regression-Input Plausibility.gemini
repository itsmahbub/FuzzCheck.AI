  "why": "The paper explicitly designs and incorporates a mechanism to enforce input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process. This is achieved through a 'GAN-based Fidelity Assurance' component. A Discriminator network is trained on the original dataset to learn the distribution of plausible inputs. During fuzzing, every mutated input is passed through this discriminator, which assigns a fidelity score. Inputs that fall below a certain fidelity threshold are filtered out. This method directly addresses the problem of cumulative mutations leading to unrealistic inputs by evaluating the overall semantic plausibility of the generated image against a learned distribution, rather than merely constraining individual mutation steps. The effectiveness of this mechanism is confirmed through an ablation study and a manual evaluation, which showed that the GAN filter successfully removed a significant percentage of low-fidelity (blurry, noisy, over-changed) inputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section III-B, GAN-based Fidelity Assurance: \"To mitigate the limitations of existing methods, we adopt Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for fidelity assurance... The Discriminator will be used to assure the fidelity of test inputs generated by DRFuzz, as it considers semantic similarity [1] rather than strict pixel-wise difference.\"\nPage 9, Section IV-B2, Contribution of the main component of DRFuzz: \"We further manually evaluate the fidelity of inputs obtained with and without the fidelity assurance mechanism. Specifically, we sample 100 inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG and DRFuzz, respectively, and two authors manually evaluate their fidelity individually... They label 86% of inputs generated by DRFuzz as high-fidelity and only 57.5% of inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG as high-fidelity. This indicates that the GAN-based Fidelity Assurance technique can filter out more than 20% of fault-triggering inputs with low fidelity.\""
