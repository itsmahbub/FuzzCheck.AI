  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces a plausibility filter on transformed inputs by requiring that any transformed text be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR system (cross-referencing) before it is considered valid, which is an explicit validation of final mutated inputs. However, the paper does not report any human evaluation or task-specific perceptual/fluency metrics (e.g., PESQ, STOI, LPIPS, SSIM, Perplexity) for final fault-inducing audio/text, nor does it describe mechanisms that bound or control cumulative drift across multiple mutation iterations. The authors also acknowledge limitations of using TTS-generated audio versus real human speech. Together, this matches the metric’s “Medium” level: plausibility of final inputs is validated, but cumulative-effects and empirical perceptual assessments are not addressed.",
  "evidence": "Section IV (USAGE), p.462: \"It is important to note that cross-referencing is used to filter the low-quality, unrealistic texts resulting from text transformation. A transformed text input must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR service to be deemed valid (or determinable); otherwise, it is deemed indeterminable and discarded.\" Section V (CHALLENGES AND FUTURE WORK), p.462: \"ASDF generates an audio test suite using a TTS library. This assumes that the generated audio is interchangeable with the real-world speech of humans, which may not be the case in real-life situations. There would still be differences between human speech and computer-generated audio, namely pronunciation, accent, and tone. As a result, if human speech were to be used instead of computer-generated audio, such inconsistencies may yield different results for our differential testing.\" (Also: Section III / Abstract describe text transformations such as tense change and homophone substitution used to generate test cases, but no human study or perceptual/fluency metrics are reported in the paper or the described evaluation.)"
