  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzing / test-generation approach operates by applying floating-point pixel-level mutations (noise, pixel crossover, L∞ constraints) directly to in-memory image tensors and does not mention or enforce any constraints to preserve perturbations under standard I/O serialization (e.g., 8-bit quantization, clipping, rounding), nor does it generate inputs directly in serialized formats. Because the method neither accounts for serialization effects during test-case generation nor during oracle/evaluation, fault-inducing perturbations introduced in memory can be lost or altered when images are saved or encoded, so the paper ignores I/O effects and therefore rates Low on Failure Reproducibility.",
  "evidence": "Page 746, Section 4 (Uncommon Data Generation) — \"Population Initialization. Given an input image, we first generate a set of images by randomly adding noise to it... We use L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed and its generated counterpart.\" \n\nPage 746, Section 4 (Uncommon Data Generation) — \"For the crossover, we adopt the tournament selection strategy ... The two selected images are used to perform the crossover by randomly exchanging the corresponding pixels. After the crossover, each image is randomly mutated by adding white noise, to increase the diversity of the population.\" \n\nPage 746, Section 5 (Evaluation, Implementation) — \"We implemented the proposed test generation tool, KuK, in Python based on Keras [5] (2.2.4) with TensorFlow [1] (1.12.0) as backend.\" \n\n(These passages show mutations are applied to image tensors via floating-point noise and pixel operations and evaluated in-memory using standard DL frameworks; the paper contains no discussion of serialization, quantization, clipping, saving to common image formats, or steps to ensure perturbations persist after typical I/O operations.)"
