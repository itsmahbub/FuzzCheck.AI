  "why": "The paper's methodology, \"linguistic-model-guided fuzzing,\" is explicitly designed to generate inputs that are plausible within the domain of human speech. Instead of applying random or unconstrained mutations that could lead to unrealistic utterances, the fuzzer (LipFuzzer) relies on 'LAPSUS Models' built from real-world linguistic knowledge. These models, based on Bayesian Networks, capture realistic speech errors related to pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, derived from academic materials and user studies. The fuzzing process is guided by these models and uses a probability-based cutoff to ensure that generated voice commands represent errors that are likely to be spoken by actual users. This approach directly enforces input plausibility by constraining mutations to a distribution of realistic human speech variations, rather than allowing cumulative drift into semantically invalid or unnatural forms.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Our Approach: \"To overcome the aforementioned design challenges, we propose a novel linguistic-model-guided fuzzing tool, called LipFuzzer... in the linguistic modeling component, we train adversarial linguistic models named LAPSUS Models by adopting Bayesian Networks (BNs). BNs are constructed statistically with linguistic knowledge related to LAPSUS. The template fuzzing is then guided with linguistic model query results.\"\n\nPage 8, Section IV-B, Weight Training: \"After we have the initial BN... ready, we further train the weight (i.e., the probabilities of successful transition states) through a user study with audio recording. In this user study, we find sentences or short expressions which contains the states in the models. Then, we ask users in the study to repeat these sentences or expressions... Next, we calculate how many times these transitions are observed.\"\n\nPage 11, Section VI-B, Cutoffs for Different Query Strategies: \"Using cutoff is important in guiding linguistic-model-guided fuzzing because there can be many ineffective fuzzing results (i.e., LAPSUS which only have a low possibility of being spoken by users). Thus, we examine how different cutoffs will affect the effective LAPSUS rate. Our goal is to find a cutoff criterion that is best for producing useful LAPSUS.\""
