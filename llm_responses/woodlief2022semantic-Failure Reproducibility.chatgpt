  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper applies semantic, metamorphic image-level mutations (e.g., adding cars/pedestrians, recoloring) rather than fine-grained numerical perturbations, so the generated failures are less likely to be fragile numerical artifacts. However, the authors do not explicitly account for standard I/O/serialization effects (clipping, quantization, rounding) nor constrain mutations to guarantee that fault-inducing changes persist after typical image serialization. Thus the work corresponds to the metric's \"semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization\" case.",
  "evidence": "Page 1960, Section 3.1 (Problem definition): \"At a conceptual level, our approach thus constitutes a form of metamorphic testing [32] where existing test cases are converted into new ones...\"; Page 1962, Section 4.1 (semImFuzz Architecture / Implementation): \"We implemented each mutation using Numpy [13] along with OpenCV for Python [4] and Pillow [6], two common image processing libraries for Python.\"; Page 1963, Section 4.3.1 (Adding an Entity - Implementation): \"When adding the entity, the mutation takes the isolated portion of the image and overlays it at the same pixel coordinates on the base image. Figure 8 demonstrates this process.\"; Page 1963, Section 4.3.2 (Potential for False Positives): \"...so semImFuzz does not attempt to add a shadow when adding an entity. This can lead to nonconforming images, as shown in Figure 9d.\" These excerpts show the approach uses semantic/metamorphic pixel-level edits (not fine numerical perturbations) but contain no statement that the design explicitly models or enforces persistence of perturbations through standard I/O operations such as quantization, clipping, or rounding."
