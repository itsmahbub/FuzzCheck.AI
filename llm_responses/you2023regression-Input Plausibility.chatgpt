  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly enforces input plausibility at each fuzzing generation and includes mechanisms to limit cumulative drift across iterations. DRFuzz (1) constrains individual mutation steps (pixel-level mutations change only 0.5% of pixels; image-level mutations are applied to the whole image to avoid partial unrealistic artifacts), (2) uses a GAN (DCGAN) Discriminator trained on the model's training set to score and filter out low-fidelity (out-of-distribution / unrealistic) candidates during fuzzing, and (3) limits repeated mutation of the same seed (max_times) and decays selection probability to avoid over-mutating seeds. The paper further reports ablation/manual-evaluation evidence that the GAN filtering substantially increases the proportion of high-fidelity inputs (86% vs. 57.5%), showing the fidelity filter is effective in practice. These design choices enforce plausibility throughout iterative mutation and address cumulative drift, matching the metric’s High level.",
  "evidence": "Section III-B (GAN-based Fidelity Assurance), p.84: \"During the fuzzing process, we feed an initial seed into the Discriminator to get a fidelity score, which serves as the fidelity threshold for filtering out the low-fidelity inputs generated from this initial seed.\"; Section III-C (Mutation Rules), p.85: \"Pixel-Level Mutation aims to change a small set of pixels in an image... DRFuzz randomly selects a small set of pixels (i.e., 0.5% total pixels) for mutation.\"; Section III-C2 (Seed Probability Update / max_times), p.86: \"max_times is the maximum number of times a seed can be mutated, which can limit the number of similar seeds and avoid significant changes causing semantic deviations from the initial seed to some degree.\"; Section IV-B2 (Ablation / fidelity evaluation), p.90: \"They label 86% of inputs generated by DRFuzz as high-fidelity and only 57.5% of inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG as high-fidelity. ... the GAN-based Fidelity Assurance technique can filter out more than 20% of fault-triggering inputs with low fidelity.\""
