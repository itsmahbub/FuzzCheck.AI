  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight using observable model internals and point-wise statistical checks, but does not explain why failures occur in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities (e.g., spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting). Concretely, the authors evaluate alternative fitness/selection signals that use model internals (loss, neuron coverage, surprise adequacy) and introduce point-wise robustness checks (classification- and loss-based) used to drive selective augmentation; they report empirical comparisons (e.g., Table 6, Table 7) showing how these internal signals correlate with robustness and training cost. However, the paper stops at using these signals as heuristics/metrics for augmentation and efficiency (and reporting robust-accuracy patterns), and does not perform a root-cause diagnostic analysis that links discovered failures to broader sources of vulnerability (no analysis of spurious features, class-level error concentration beyond aggregate robust accuracy, or neuron-level explanations of failure modes).",
  "evidence": "Page 1150, Section 3.3.3 (Fitness function): \"Other metrics as fitness function. Any metric that quantifies the quality of a DNN with respect to a test input may be used as a fitness function. Some of the concrete examples include neuron coverage [24] and surprise adequacy [15].\"; Page 1150, Section 3.4 (Selective Augmentation): \"Classification-based robustness. A model is point-wise robust w.r.t. a data-point x if and only if it classifies x and all the label preserving realistic variations (x') correctly. Loss-based robustness. A model is point-wise robust w.r.t. a data-point x if and only if the prediction loss of x or any label preserving realistic variations (x') is not greater than a loss threshold.\"; Page 1156, Section 5.5.2 (Fitness function results / Table 6): \"The results show that both loss-based and coverage-based fitness functions achieve very similar robust accuracy. Since surprise adequacy is correlated to neuron coverage [15], we expect a similar performance also using surprise adequacy. However, loss based fitness function may be a better choice since neuron coverage based fitness function increases the training time by 50% than that of loss-based fitness function.\"; Page 1156, Section 5.5.3 (Selection metrics / Table 7): \"The evaluation results in Table 7 show that the loss-based selection outperforms the classification-based selection for all the models. The reason is that the loss-based selection is more conservative than the classification-based selection.\""
