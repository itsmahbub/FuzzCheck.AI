  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight beyond merely reporting failures: it analyzes observable model behavior (state coverage, a robustness/sensitivity measure, and distributional patterns of crashes) and performs ablation studies showing the role of the curiosity signal. These constitute statistical and behavioral diagnostics that help explain where and when the SDMs fail. However, the paper does not perform deeper internal model analysis (e.g., neuron activations, layer-wise behavior) nor does it directly link discovered failures to specific underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious/non-robust features, dataset bias, or overfitting. Therefore the appropriate rating is Medium.",
  "evidence": "p.6, Section 3.4 (Algorithm 3 - Robustness Estimation): \"Robustness is then measured as the Euclidean distance between the final states of S and S_δ, which essentially is |S_{-1} - S_δ_{-1}|. Robustness is a measure of how sensitive an SDM’s behavior is to slight perturbations in the original state.\" \n\np.8, Section 5 (Coverage Analysis): \"Coverage analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating the thoroughness and completeness of a testing technique. ... we measure the environmental state coverage ... we discretize the state space ...\" (Table 1 reports state coverage comparisons across methods.)\n\np.9, Section 5 (Total Number of Crashes / visualization): \"In Figure 2, ... G-Model tends to find the crashes that the agents are positioned around the boundary of the valid input. In contrast, CureFuzz covers more spread positions.\" (Figure 2 visualizes distributional differences in crash-triggering positions.)\n\np.10, Section 5 (RQ2 ablation / role of curiosity): \"For this research question, we ... remove the curiosity component from CureFuzz and conduct the fuzzing again ... We can observe that the addition of the curiosity mechanism plays a vital role in boosting the effectiveness of CureFuzz ...\" (Figure 3 and Table 5 show ablation results.)\n\np.11, Section 6 (Discussion - epistemic uncertainty): \"The curiosity mechanism’s optimization process ... The prediction error of the target network and the predictor network then serves as a proxy for measuring uncertainty, specifically epistemic uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty would be particularly high in regions of the input space where few similar examples were seen ... By focusing on areas of high epistemic uncertainty ... the testing process inherently explores a wider variety of scenarios.\" \n\np.10, Section 5 (RQ3 repair result): \"For the repaired ACAS Xu, 55 faults and 4 distinct types of crash-triggering scenarios are detected. We find that the crashes found by CureFuzz are reduced by 73% compared with the original DNN model.\""
