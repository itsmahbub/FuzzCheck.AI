  "value": "High",
  "why": "CrossASR does not perform iterative, cumulative perturbations of audio inputs. Instead it synthesizes speech from natural text using off-the-shelf TTS systems and uses preprocessing/normalization to ensure proper pronunciation for TTS. Inputs to ASRs are thus natural TTS-generated speech (not heavily distorted or mutated across iterations), and the paper explicitly treats cases where all ASRs disagree as possibly a TTS issue. The authors also run experiments with multiple TTSes to avoid bias from an unrealistic generator. These design choices enforce that generated inputs remain plausible within the speech domain throughout testing.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.640): \"CrossASR ... capitalizes the existing Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems to automatically generate test cases for ASR systems.\"; Section I / Introduction (p.641): \"CrossASR employs Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines to synthesize test inputs from texts and treats the texts as the ground truth labels, removing the need of manually transcribing audio files for getting labelled data.\"; Section II-A Architecture (p.642): \"The TTS converts the Text into a Speech Audio.\" and \"We consider cases where all ASRs’ transcribed texts differ from the input text as indeterminable cases – as possibly the error resides in the TTS.\"; Section II-B Test Selection Engine (p.642): \"The Text Preprocessor lowercases the text, removes punctuation from it, and normalizes non-standard words ... This normalization is intended to ensure that the text are pronounced properly by TTS.\"; Threats to Validity (p.646): \"Text-to-Speech is a crucial part of CrossASR system. The quality of a generated speech by TTS affects the number of test cases generated. Instead of running the experiment using one TTS, we run on 4 TTSes to minimize a potential bias that come from the usage of one TTS.\""
