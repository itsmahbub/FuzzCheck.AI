  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "CureFuzz enforces plausibility constraints at each mutation step by restricting mutated seeds to the environment's legitimate state space and discarding illegal or initially crashing states (per-environment validity checks and simulator-based filtering). It also uses only ‘small random perturbations’ when mutating seeds. However, the paper does not describe mechanisms that explicitly prevent or measure cumulative drift across many fuzzing iterations nor report any human or quantitative perceptual/semantic plausibility assessments (e.g., LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity) for final fault-inducing inputs. The evaluation metrics focus on coverage and crash counts rather than input realism. This matches the metric’s Medium definition: plausibility is enforced at individual mutation steps or by rule-based validity checks, but cumulative-effects and explicit plausibility validation of final fault-inducing inputs are not addressed.",
  "evidence": "3.4 CureFuzz Architecture (Seed Mutation): \"The Seed-Mutation function generates a new mutated state by applying a small random perturbation to a selected state. ... We need to ensure that the mutated seed lies in the legitimate state spaces , and the mutated seed would not trigger an initial crash. In our experiments, we have carefully addressed this concern and verified the validity of each mutated seed, details are given in Section 4.\" (Section 3.4)\n\n4.2.1 Autonomous Driving (CARLA): \"We use the CARLA simulator itself to check for the validity of the mutated state. All illegally mutated states and the states that trigger initial collision are discarded in our experiments.\" (Section 4.2.1)\n\n4.2.2 Aircraft Collision Avoidance (ACAS Xu): \"Given the predefined range of acceptable states, states that fall outside legal space are automatically discarded.\" (Section 4.2.2)\n\n4.2.3 Coop Navi (MARL) / BipedalWalker: \"With a clear definition of permissible positions and velocities, CureFuzz ignores any illegal states.\" and \"Since the valid ground types are known, illegal states can be easily detected and discarded.\" (Section 4.2.3 and 4.2.4)\n\n4.3 Implementation (mutation magnitude): \"When mutating a seed, the magnitude of the random perturbation is a critical factor that can impact the performance of the fuzzer. We re-use the code implementation from Pang et al. for generating mutations.\" (Section 4.3)\n\n5 Evaluation metrics (lack of perceptual plausibility measures): \"Our evaluation focuses on three key metrics: environmental state coverage, the total number of detected crash-triggering scenarios, and the distinct types of crash-triggering scenarios.\" (Section 5, RQ1 description)  -- no human studies or perceptual/semantic quality metrics (e.g., LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity) are reported."
