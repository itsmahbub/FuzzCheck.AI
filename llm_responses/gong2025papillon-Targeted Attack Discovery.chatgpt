  "why": "PAPILLON is explicitly designed to steer fuzzing toward producing jailbreaks—i.e., causing models to generate harmful or policy-violating responses for given harmful questions—by using question-dependent mutation operators and a two-level judge that checks both harmfulness and relevance. However, the paper frames the attacker goal as eliciting harmful/unsafe behavior (jailbreaks) and relevant harmful answers to the posed questions, not as inducing specific, attacker-chosen target outputs or exact phrases. Thus it addresses broader classes of security-violating behavior (jailbreaks) rather than precise targeted outputs.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.2401): \"attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content.\"; Section 3 Threat Model (p.2406): \"The objective of the attack is to craft jailbreak prompts for a collection of harmful or unethical questions that compel the target LLM to provide actual responses. Specifically, our goals are: 1) To circumvent the safety mechanisms of the target LLM... 2) To ensure that the responses to these questions are not only correct and relevant but also contain the harmful content intended by the query.\"; Section 4.2 (Template Mutation and Optimization, p.2408): \"we design three novel question-dependent mutation strategies capable of generating mutations with semantic meaning and limited token length by leveraging the power of an LLM helper.\"; Section 4.3 Two-level Judge Module (p.2409): \"To evaluate whether a response is jailbroken, the judge model should be based on its harmfulness and its relevance to the harmful question... The first judge model is a fine-tuned RoBERTa model... We further used GPT-3.5 turbo for an additional round of judgment... This additional check improved the credibility of the jailbreak assessment and ensured the response content aligned with the query.\""
