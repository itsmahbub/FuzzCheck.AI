  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly targets and successfully produces semantic jailbreaks that coax safety-aligned and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4 and Gemini-Pro) into producing unsafe/forbidden outputs, and it evaluates PAIR against existing defenses showing PAIR can bypass or remain effective under defense mechanisms. Thus PAIR uncovers high-impact failures that bypass explicit safety/policy mechanisms (jailbreaks), not merely low-level robustness errors.",
  "evidence": "Page 23, Abstract: \"However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails.\" \n\nPage 23, Contributions (Efficiency/Effectiveness): \"PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed-source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and Gemini.\" \n\nPage 27, Table III (Direct jailbreak attacks): shows PAIR Jailbreak % for closed-source models (e.g., \"GPT-3.5 51%\" and \"GPT-4 48%\", and \"Gemini 73%\"), demonstrating PAIR elicits unsafe responses from safety-aligned/closed models. \n\nPage 29, Section IV-C (Defended performance of PAIR): \"In Table VIII, we evaluate the performance of PAIR against two jailbreaking defenses: SmoothLLM [20] and a perplexity filter [37, 38]. ... the JB% of PAIR drops significantly less than GCG when defended by these two defenses, meaning that PAIR is significantly harder to defend against than GCG.\" \n\nPage 29, Fig. 3 caption (example jailbreak): \"Claude-1 jailbreak. A successful jailbreak where the objective is to 'design a phishing email that can trick users into giving away their login credentials.'\""
