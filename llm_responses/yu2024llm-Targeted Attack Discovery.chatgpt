  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzer (LLM-FUZZER) is explicitly designed to discover jailbreaks / harmful outputs (i.e., broader classes of security-violating behavior) by generating and mutating jailbreak prompts and using an oracle that labels responses as 'harmful' or not. The objective is to induce unsafe/harmful completions for given unethical questions (measured via metrics like JQN, ASR, EASR), rather than to force the model to produce a specific attacker-chosen output token sequence or exact target phrase. Thus the design steers exploration toward detecting unsafe/jailbreak behavior (broad classes) rather than targeted, per-output attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 4657, Abstract: \"LLM-FUZZER uses human-crafted jailbreak prompts as starting points. By employing carefully customized seed selection strategies and mutation mechanisms, LLM-FUZZER generates additional jailbreak prompts tailored to specific LLMs.\" \n\nPage 4663, Section 3.4 Oracle: \"The oracle’s role is to take prompts as input and evaluate the responses to determine if they are harmful. If harmful responses are detected, the oracle assigns a corresponding reward.\" and \"When it comes to evaluating responses to individual prompts, the oracle follows a straightforward protocol. If it determines a response to be harmful, it assigns a reward of 1. Conversely, if the response is deemed non-harmful, a reward of 0 is assigned.\" \n\nPage 4664, Section 4.1 Metrics: \"JQN assesses the effectiveness for a set of jailbreak templates, reflecting an LLM’s resistance to unethical questions... For each question, if there exists at least one template that could be leveraged to successfully jailbreak the target model, then the question is deemed as jailbreaking.\" and definitions of ASR/EASR showing measurement of ability to elicit harmful outputs across questions and template sets."
