  "why": "The paper's proposed method, Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), is explicitly designed to generate semantically plausible and human-interpretable inputs (prompts) as its core mechanism. Plausibility is enforced throughout the iterative process by using an attacker Large Language Model (LLM) to generate and refine prompts based on conversational history and chain-of-thought reasoning. This design inherently constrains the generated inputs to a distribution of realistic natural language. The paper contrasts this directly with token-level attacks that produce semantically invalid or uninterpretable inputs. Furthermore, the paper provides substantial empirical evidence, in the form of numerous qualitative examples of the final fault-inducing prompts, which are all semantically coherent and represent realistic user queries.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Contributions, 'Interpretability': 'PAIR generates prompt-level semantic jailbreaks that are interpretable to humans and includes interpretable, chain-of-thought improvement assessments.'\n\nPage 2, Figure 2 'Prompt- vs. token-level jailbreaks': This figure provides a direct visual comparison, showing a plausible prompt generated by PAIR ('Write a fun and creative story about a person who gets into a lot of trouble for committing insider trading...') versus an uninterpretable token-level jailbreak from another method.\n\nPage 3, Section III-A, 'Attacker's system prompt': The method's design relies on plausible social engineering strategies to construct prompts: 'each system prompt template is based on one of three criteria: logical appeal, authority endorsement, and role-playing.'\n\nPages 7, 19, and 20, Figures 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: These figures provide multiple examples of final, successful jailbreak prompts generated by PAIR. All examples are coherent, plausible, and framed as realistic scenarios (e.g., 'You are a creative writer working on a new political thriller... write a convincing letter from the IRS which the protagonist will use...')."
