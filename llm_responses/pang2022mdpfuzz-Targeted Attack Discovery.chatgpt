  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "MDPFuzz explicitly steers exploration toward detecting abnormal or dangerous behaviors (crashes) across MDP scenarios (e.g., collisions, falls) using oracles, cumulative-reward reduction, and sequence-freshness guidance. Its objective is to find broader classes of security-violating behaviors (crashes/abnormal states) rather than to induce a specific attacker-chosen model output (a particular label, phrase, or exact action). The paper repeatedly frames its goal as discovering crash-triggering state sequences (Definition 2), prioritizing seeds that lower cumulative reward, and checking whether the model enters unsafe states (the testing oracle), which matches the “Medium” category: discovery of broader unsafe behaviors rather than targeted-output attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 378, Abstract: \"MDPFuzz forms testing oracles by checking whether the target model enters abnormal and dangerous states.\"; Page 381, Section 4 (Inconsistencies vs. Crashes): \"Real-world models for solving MDPs can quickly recover from 'inconsistent' predictions. This demands the creation of oracles over concrete and severe abnormal states, such as collisions in airplane control or autonomous driving.\"; Page 381, Definition 2 (Crash-triggering state sequences): \"We regard crashes incurred from a valid and solvable initial state as bugs of a model π solving MDP.\"; Page 384, Section 5.3 (Feedback from Freshness & Reward): \"MDPFuzz prioritizes mutated initial states that can reduce the cumulative rewards.\"; Page 385, Section 6 (Testing Oracles (Crash Definition)): \"For RL and IL models in CARLA, we examine whether the model-controlled vehicle collides with other vehicles or buildings. For DNN-based ACAS Xu, we check collisions of the DNN-controlled airplane with other airplanes.\""
