  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility in individual mutation steps using domain-specific, semantics-preserving mutation policies (e.g., EDA-based text mutations, SMILES enumeration for molecules) and by defining an oracle via norm-balls (r_oracle) intended to capture human-indistinguishability for continuous inputs. These design choices validate that many generated inputs remain realistic. However, the paper does not present any explicit mechanism to prevent cumulative drift across multiple mutation iterations (i.e., it does not enforce a global bound or filtering of plausibility across generations), nor does it report empirical human evaluation or task-specific perceptual/fluency metrics (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM, PESQ, STOI, Perplexity) to quantify the perceptual or semantic realism of the final fault-inducing inputs. Therefore the work enforces plausibility at the mutation-step / domain-rule level and validates plausibility conceptually, but overlooks cumulative effects and lacks quantitative or human-subjective evidence for final test cases.",
  "evidence": "• Abstract (page 1191): “...owing to its working with finer temporal semantics and the consideration of the naturalness of input perturbation.”\n\n• Section VI-B, Mutation Policies — Random Mutation (page 1197): “When the LSTM input has continuous values (e.g., image input), Gaussian noises with fixed mean and variance are added to the input. Meanwhile, for discrete value input (e.g., IMDB movie reviews for sentiment analysis), a set of problem-specific mutation functions M are defined.”\n\n• Section VII-A, Experimental Setup — Input Mutation (page 1199): “To avoid this, we take a set M of mutants from the EDA toolkit [48], which was originally designed to augment the training data for improvement on text classification tasks. This ensures the mutated text paragraphs are always valid.”\n\n• Section VI-C1, Test Oracle (page 1198): “We define a set of norm-balls, each of which is centered around a data sample with known label. The radius r_oracle of norm-balls intuitively means that a human cannot differentiate between inputs within a norm ball.”\n\n• Section VII-A4, Oracle Setting (page 1199 / Table II discussion): “Note, we let r_oracle = None for the Lipophilicity model, suggesting that no constraint is imposed on the norm ball.”\n\n• Algorithm 1 (page 1197): shows orig mapping initialized for seeds and used only in the oracle check (detection): “orig[x] <- x for all x ∈ T0” and later “if ||orig[x] - x'||2 ≤ r_oracle, and φ(orig[x]) ≠ φ(x') then Tadv ← Tadv ∪ {x'}”, indicating the paper checks distance to original seeds to label adversarial cases but does not describe rejecting or constraining candidates across successive mutation iterations to prevent cumulative drift.\n\n• Introduction / Motivation (page 1192): the authors assert their goal that generated cases be realistic: “...our diversified test cases are 'closer' to their seeds (points on the RNN’s data manifold), compared to other state-of-the-art tools, implying higher chance to be seen in the real-life operation, thus preserving the naturalness.”\n\n• Absence of empirical perceptual/fluency evaluation: The paper does not report any human studies or quantitative perceptual/semantic measures (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM, PESQ, STOI, Perplexity) for assessing the realism or naturalness of final fault-inducing inputs (no such metrics or human-evaluation results appear in the Experimental Evaluation sections or tables)."
