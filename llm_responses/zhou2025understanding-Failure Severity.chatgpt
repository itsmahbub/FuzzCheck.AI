  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly targets jailbreak attacks (high-impact security failures) and demonstrates that coverage-guided techniques both (1) generate successful jailbreak examples that bypass model alignment/safety behavior and (2) detect jailbreak queries in safety-aligned models. The authors report that attack queries can \"bypass\" safety neurons in well-aligned models and show coverage-guided generation produces substantially more successful jailbreaks than random; they also evaluate on an aligned model (Llama-2-7B-Chat) and report high success/detection results. These statements and empirical results indicate the method uncovers high-severity failures (jailbreaks that violate safety/policy mechanisms) rather than only low-level robustness errors.",
  "evidence": "Page 730, Abstract (Application summary): \"we develop a real-time jailbreak detection mechanism that achieves high accuracy (93.61% on average) ... Lastly, we introduce a coverage-guided approach for generating jailbreak attack examples, enabling systematic refinement of prompts to uncover vulnerabilities.\"; Page 736, IV.B / RQ1 (attack bypass observation): \"...we observe significant coverage differences between normal (SN) and abnormal outputs (SNJ) in well-aligned models. Well-aligned models have safety neurons to reject malicious queries [46], but attack queries often bypass these and activate neurons linked to abnormal behaviors.\"; Page 739, V.C (generation results): \"As shown in Figure 6, the coverage-guided method outperforms the random strategy in generating successful jailbreak queries... These results confirm that coverage gains effectively guide query generation toward unexplored areas, increasing the number of successful jailbreak cases and enhancing robustness testing for LLMs.\"; Page 738–739, V.A / Table V (detection on aligned model): \"As shown in Table V, our method achieves high average accuracies: 95.23% on OPT-125M, 93.92% on Llama-2-7B-Chat, and 91.69% on Pythia-12B, demonstrating its effectiveness across models.\""
