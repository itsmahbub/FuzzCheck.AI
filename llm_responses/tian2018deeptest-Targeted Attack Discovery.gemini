  "why": "The paper's method, DeepTest, performs untargeted exploration to discover generic failures. Its primary objective is to maximize neuron coverage to explore different parts of the DNN's logic, rather than steering the model towards a specific, predefined output. The error detection mechanism, or oracle, is based on metamorphic relations. It identifies erroneous behaviors by detecting inconsistencies in the model's predictions when the input is subjected to realistic transformations (e.g., changes in brightness, weather conditions). Specifically, it flags cases where the steering angle changes significantly after a minor, realistic transformation is applied to an input image. This approach is designed to find any unexpected or inconsistent behavior, which aligns with the definition of 'untargeted exploration' and the discovery of 'inconsistent predictions' described in the 'Low' category of the metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.4, Creating a Test Oracle with Metamorphic Relations: \"To avoid this issue, we leverage metamorphic relations [33] between the car behaviors across different synthetic images. The key insight is that even though it is hard to specify the correct behavior of a self-driving car for every transformed image, one can define relationships between the car's behaviors across certain types of transformations. For example, the autonomous car's steering angle should not change significantly for the same image under any lighting/weather conditions, blurring, or any affine transformations with small parameter values.\""
