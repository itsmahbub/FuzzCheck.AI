  "why": "CrossASR generates test inputs by synthesizing speech from natural texts (Europarl) via TTS engines rather than applying unconstrained, accumulating perturbations. The paper describes explicit text preprocessing (normalization) “intended to ensure that the text are pronounced properly by TTS” (preventing implausible TTS outputs), uses multiple real-world TTSes to avoid bias, and treats texts from a real corpus as the input distribution. Importantly, the authors perform a human verification on a statistically representative sample of final failed test cases (395 samples) and report low false positive rates (12 false positives out of 395), explicitly noting that the failed cases are “audio understandable to humans but cannot be transcribed properly by an ASR.” These design choices and the human evaluation demonstrate that CrossASR enforces and empirically validates input plausibility for final fault-inducing inputs.",
  "evidence": "Intro / Abstract (page 640): \"CrossASR employs Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines to synthesize test inputs from texts and treats the texts as the ground truth labels...\"; Architecture / Text preprocessing (Section II-A / II-B, page 643): \"The Text Preprocessor lowercases the text, removes punctuation from it, and normalizes non-standard words... This normalization is intended to ensure that the text are pronounced properly by TTS.\"; Experimental validation / RQ4 & manual check (Section III-D, pages 645-647): \"we ask a native English speaker, who is not an author of this paper to verify whether the failed test cases generated by CrossASR are actual failed test cases...\" and Table VI reporting low FPRs; Discussion / manual sample analysis (page 647): \"From 33,618 failed test cases, we manually verified a statistically representative sample of size 395 and found 12 of them to be false positives.\"; Abstract / Conclusion (page 640 / 649): \"Based on a manual verification carried out on statistically representative sample size, we found that most samples are actual failed test cases (audio understandable to humans but cannot be transcribed properly by an ASR).\""
