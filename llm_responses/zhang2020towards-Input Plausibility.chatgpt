  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility constraints at the mutation/population level (bounded L∞ perturbations relative to the original seed, small mutation rate, and avoidance of some transformations that produce invalid images), which constrains individual mutation steps and helps keep candidates visually reasonable. However, the method does not describe additional mechanisms to prevent or monitor cumulative drift across multiple GA iterations (e.g., projection/clipping after crossover, perceptual similarity metrics, or distributional filtering), nor does it report human/perceptual validation of final outputs. Thus plausibility is enforced between/since individual mutation steps but the paper does not explicitly address accumulation of perturbations over iterative generations.",
  "evidence": "Page 746, Section 4 (Population Initialization): \"In order to generate high-quality images (i.e., recognizable by human), we abandon the affine transformation (e.g., translation and rotation [55]) as the crossover may generate invalid images. We use L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed and its generated counterpart.\" \n\nPage 746, Section 4 (Crossover and Mutation): \"The two selected images are used to perform the crossover by randomly exchanging the corresponding pixels. After the crossover, each image is randomly mutated by adding white noise, to increase the diversity of the population.\" \n\nPage 746, Section 5.1 (RQ3 Setting): \"For the mutation process, the radius of L∞ is set as 0.3.\""
