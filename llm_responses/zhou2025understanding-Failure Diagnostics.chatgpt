  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides substantive diagnostic insight into why jailbreak failures occur by analyzing observable model internals and statistical failure patterns: it performs a clustering analysis of hidden states, measures neuron-level coverage differences across criteria, layers, blocks, and tokens, introduces a Relative Coverage Growth (RCG) metric, and uses activated-neuron features to build a jailbreak detector. These analyses connect discovered failures to internal activation patterns and layer/block/token contributions (i.e., model internals and statistical patterns). However, the paper does not demonstrate a causal linkage from failures to broader underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on non-robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting — it offers plausible hypotheses (e.g., neurons associated with knowledge domains) but no direct causal evidence. Therefore the correct rating is Medium.",
  "evidence": "III.A Motivation: A Cluster Analysis Experiment (p. 732): \"In summary, our clustering analysis demonstrates that the internal states of the model include features capable of representing and distinguishing the ‘logic’ of different behaviors. This confirms the feasibility of using internal states to design coverage criteria for LLMs.\"; IV.B RQ1 results / statistical coverage patterns (pp. 735–736, Table IV): \"The average coverage growth calculated on the Attention layer for NC, TKNC, TKNP, TFC, and NLC registers at 3.16%, 7.50%, 33.02%, 24.09%, and 2.77%, respectively...\" (demonstrates statistical analysis of failure/attack vs. normal inputs); IV.C RQ2 (p. 736): definition of RCG and layer/block analysis: \"RCG = max(C_SNJ - C_SNS / C_SN, 0)\" and discussion that \"Attention layers are more effective than MLP layers for optimizing coverage analysis in LLMs\" and that certain blocks show high RCG (identifying block-level diagnostic signals); V.A Jailbreak Detection (pp. 738–739 & Table V): \"Due to the significant differences in the parts of the model covered by normal queries and jailbreak attacks, we design a detection method based on the number of activated neurons (the feature used by NC). Specifically, we train an MLP model that uses the number of activated neurons as input to derive a binary result...\" (shows use of internal activation features for diagnostics/applications); IV.B (p. 736) speculative interpretation without causal proof: \"This may be because LLMs associate specific neurons with different knowledge domains... Abnormal behaviors... activate distinct knowledge areas, triggering neurons linked to negative or harmful knowledge domains,\" (suggests a hypothesis but does not establish causal linkage to spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting)."
