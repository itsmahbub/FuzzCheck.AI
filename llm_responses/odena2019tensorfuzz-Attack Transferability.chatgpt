  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly reuses fault-inducing inputs generated by fuzzing one model (the 32-bit model) to test another implementation (the 16-bit quantized/truncated model) and reports that many such inputs cause disagreements. However, the fuzzing framework is presented as a general-purpose CGF + PBT tool rather than being explicitly designed primarily to discover transferable attacks across different model implementations; the cross-model experiment is an application/example rather than a described core design goal. Thus the work demonstrates transferability reuse but the fuzzing design is not explicitly aimed at discovering transferable attacks across models.",
  "evidence": "Section 6, 'TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions': \"We then ran the fuzzer with mutations restricted to lie in a radius 0.4 infinity norm ball surrounding the seed images, using the activations of only the 32-bit model as coverage. ... With these settings, the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried.\" Also in same subsection: \"As a baseline experiment, we trained an MNIST classifier (this time without intentionally introducing numerical issues) using 32-bit floating point numbers. We then truncated all weights and activations to 16-bits. We then compared the predictions of the 32-bit and the 16-bit model on the MNIST test set and found 0 disagreements.\""
