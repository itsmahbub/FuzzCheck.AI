  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper proposes methods for generating and detecting adversarial samples for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The core methodology involves creating a model-specific abstraction (a Discrete-Time Markov Chain or DTMC) based on the internal state transitions of a single, trained RNN. The evaluation is conducted on multiple models performing the same tasks (e.g., MNIST-LSTM and MNIST-GRU for image classification). However, the adversarial samples are always generated for a specific model and then evaluated on that same model. The paper does not perform any experiments where fault-inducing inputs generated for one model are reused to test for failures on another model. The methodology is inherently designed to analyze a single model at a time and lacks any mechanism to support the discovery of transferable failures.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Algorithm 2, \"Coverage guided testing of RNN\": The algorithm for generating adversarial samples takes a single \"RNN-based DL system, M: Abstract model of D\" as input. All subsequent steps within the testing loop, including prediction, coverage analysis, and failure checking, are performed with respect to this single model `D` and its abstract model `M`. This demonstrates the single-model focus of the generation technique.\n\nPage 10, Section 6.4, \"RQ3. Adversarial Sample Detection\": In the setup for evaluating the detection mechanism, the paper states: \"With the constructed dataset, we trained a classifier for each model to detect adversarial samples.\" This confirms that the detection process is model-specific and does not involve testing the transferability of adversarial examples between different models.\n\nPage 10, Section 6.5, \"RQ4. Coverage-guided Testing\": The evaluation of the coverage-guided testing is presented separately for MNIST-LSTM and MNIST-GRU in Table 6. The accompanying text describes the testing process for each model independently, without any mention of cross-testing the generated adversarial samples between the two models."
