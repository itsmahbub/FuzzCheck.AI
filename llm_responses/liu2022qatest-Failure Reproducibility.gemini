  "why": "The method proposed in the paper, QATest, generates test cases by applying metamorphic transformations directly to natural language text to create new questions. These transformations include operations like synonym replacement, reverse translation, introducing typos (keyboard mistakes), and simulating OCR errors. The resulting test inputs are new text strings. The metric definition explicitly states: \"We also consider fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., synthesized speech, rendered images, or generated text) as reproducible under this metric, since such inputs are inherently stable with respect to standard I/O operations.\" The perturbations introduced by QATest are at the character or word level (e.g., changing 'number' to 'numbfr'), which are discrete and not susceptible to the numerical fragility issues like rounding, clipping, or quantization that the metric is designed to guard against. By generating inputs directly in their final text format, the framework inherently ensures that any fault-inducing perturbations are stable and reproducible under standard I/O operations.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.2, \"Test Generation with MRs\": \"To simulate the possible question QA systems may receive in real usage scenarios, we implement three textual semantically consistent transformations, i.e., grammatical component-based, sentence structure-based, and adversarial perturbation-based transformations.\"\n\nPage 6, Table 1, \"Example questions with metamorphic transformations.\": This table provides concrete examples of the text-based mutations, such as 'Original question: What is a string over a Greek number when considering a computational problem?' being transformed into 'Keyboard mistake: What is a string over a Greek numbfr when considering a computational problem?'. This demonstrates the generation of discrete, reproducible text inputs."
