  "value": "Low",
  "why": "DeepEvolution does not demonstrate attack transferability across independently trained model implementations on the same task. The paper only reuses generated fault‐inducing inputs to compare a model with its own quantized variant, not to test different models (e.g., using LeNet inputs on another MNIST model or CifarNet inputs on another CIFAR-10 model). There is no experimental evaluation or design mechanism aimed at assessing whether faults transfer across distinct model architectures trained for the same task.",
  "evidence": "Section III (page 455) describes follow-up tests only between the original DNN and its quantized version. Section V.D (pages 456–457) evaluates quantization defects by comparing each model to its own truncated-precision variant; no experiments reuse inputs across different model implementations performing the same task."
