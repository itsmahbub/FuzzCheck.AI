  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight via statistical analyses of failures (attack success rates across models, defenses, cross-sample universality, ablations) and interprets these patterns to form hypotheses about causes (e.g., overfitting of token-gradient methods). However, it does not perform analysis of observable model internals (neuron activations, coverage, layer-wise behavior) or present empirical diagnostics that directly link failures to underlying model vulnerabilities (e.g., concrete evidence of reliance on non-robust/spurious features or dataset bias). Thus it meets the criterion for Medium: statistical/failure-pattern analysis is present, but internal-model diagnostic analysis is absent.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.1 (Metrics): \"The first metric is the keyword-based attack success rate (ASR) ... The second metric is the GPT recheck attack success rate (Recheck). ... In both metrics, we report the final success rate calculated by Isuccess/Itotal. For stealthiness, we use standard Sentence Perplexity (PPL) evaluated by GPT-2 as the metric.\"  \n\nPage 8, Section 4.2 (Transferability): \"We speculate that the potential reason is the semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts may be inherently more transferable than the methods based on tokens’ gradients. As GCG-like method directly optimizes the jailbreak prompt by the gradient information, it is likely for the algorithm to get relatively overfitting in the white-box model.\"  \n\nPage 7, Section 4.2 (Effectiveness against defense): \"As demonstrated in Tab. 3, the perplexity defense significantly undermines the effectiveness of the token-level jailbreak attack, i.e., GCG attack. However, the semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts AutoDAN (and the original handcrafted DAN) is not influenced. These findings underscore the capability of our method to generate semantically meaningful content similar to benign text, verifying the stealthiness of our method.\"  \n\nPage 5, Section 3.3 (Fitness Evaluation): \"Since the goal of jailbreak attacks can be formulated as Eq. 2, we can directly use a function that calculates this likelihood for evaluating the fitness of the individuals in genetic algorithms. Here, we adopt the log-likelihood that was introduced by Zou et al. (2023) as the loss function...\"  \n\nNote on absence of internal-model diagnostics: The paper's methodological and evaluation sections (e.g., Sections 3 and 4, Tables 1–5, Ablation studies) report and analyze output-level statistics (ASR, Recheck, PPL), cross-model and cross-sample patterns, and module ablations, but contain no sections or quoted analyses of model internals such as neuron activation frequency, layer-wise behavior, coverage metrics, or empirical linking of failures to specific spurious/non-robust features (beyond the speculative statement about overfitting above)."
