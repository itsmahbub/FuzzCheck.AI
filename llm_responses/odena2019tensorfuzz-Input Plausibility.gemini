  "why": "The paper explicitly describes and implements a mutation strategy designed to maintain input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process by preventing cumulative drift. Specifically, it constrains mutated inputs to remain within a user-configurable L-infinity norm ball around the *original seed input* from which they are descended, not just the immediate parent. The authors state this is to ensure the generated inputs are \"still plausibly of the same 'class' as the original input\" and to avoid testing on \"out-of-domain garbage data\". This directly addresses the metric's requirement of enforcing plausibility throughout fuzzing iterations to keep inputs within a plausible distribution.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 5, Mutator: \"The second is to add white noise, but to constrain the difference between the mutated element and the original element from which it is descended to have a user-configurable L∞ norm. This type of constrained mutation can be useful if we want to find inputs that satisfy some objective function, but are still plausibly of the same 'class' as the original input that was used as a seed.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 6, TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions: \"We then ran the fuzzer with mutations restricted to lie in a radius 0.4 infinity norm ball surrounding the seed images... We restrict to inputs near seed images because these inputs nearly all have unambiguous class semantics. It is less interesting if two versions of the model disagree on out-of-domain garbage data with no true class.\""
