  "value": "Low",
  "why": "DeepXplore’s approach requires whitebox access to multiple DNNs during test generation and optimizes inputs to provoke disagreements among them. It does not generate fault-inducing inputs on a surrogate model and then reuse those inputs (without internal access) to trigger failures in independently trained or unseen target models. Thus, it does not evaluate or support the traditional notion of attack transferability from one model to another.",
  "evidence": "Page 1 (Abstract): “Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles…”; Page 5 (Section 3 Overview): “DeepXplore takes unlabeled test inputs as seeds … while causing the tested DNNs to behave differently.”; Page 6 (Algorithm 1 inputs): “dnns ← multiple DNNs under test” and selection of one DNN from dnns for optimization; Page 14 (Section 8 Limitations): “differential testing requires at least two different DNNs with the same functionality… DeepXplore cannot operate in the single-surrogate transfer scenario.”"
