  "why": "The paper's methodology for generating and selecting test cases for Large Language Models (LLMs) operates entirely within the text domain. The inputs are prompts sourced from datasets, created by paraphrasing, or generated by appending suffixes or rewriting existing prompts. Text is an inherently serialized format, and the perturbations (the specific words and structures that constitute a 'jailbreak attack') are symbolic, not numerical. These inputs are not susceptible to the kind of information loss (e.g., from quantization, rounding, or clipping) that the metric describes for image or audio data when saved to disk. The metric definition explicitly states: 'We also consider fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., ... generated text) as reproducible under this metric, since such inputs are inherently stable with respect to standard I/O operations.' The paper's approach of generating and using text prompts perfectly aligns with this criterion, ensuring that the fault-inducing inputs are fully reproducible under any standard I/O operation.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section III-A, 'Findings': 'Attack queries are generated by appending adversarial suffixes to rejected queries using GCG [7]. These queries aim to trigger the model to output malicious content (i.e., abnormal behaviors).' This describes a text-based generation method. \nPage 6, Section IV-A, 'Test Suite Construction': 'To construct synonymous queries, we use GPT-4 to generate corresponding synonymous paraphrases for the first 500 queries from the Alpaca-gpt4 dataset...'\nPage 11, Section V-C, 'Jailbreak Case Generation': 'Setup: We use Llama-2-7b-chat as the target model, initializing with five jailbreak queries as seeds. Over five iterations, GPT-4 generates ten new jailbreak queries per round through prompt rewriting.' All these methods generate test cases directly in their final, serialized text format."
