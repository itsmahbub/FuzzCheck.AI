  "why": "The paper explicitly designs mutation operators and checks that constrain mutations across iterative fuzzing (e.g., allowing at most one affine transform per mutation chain, and bounding cumulative pixel changes via L0/L∞ computed relative to a reference image), thereby enforcing plausibility throughout sequential mutations. In addition, the authors performed a human user study that empirically measured the perceptual validity of generated tests (45,000 images total) and report low invalidity rates for DeepHunter (e.g., 1.2% MNIST, 2.9% CIFAR-10, 0.8% ImageNet). These two facts show the method both enforces plausibility across iterations and provides empirical evidence that final generated (including fault-inducing) inputs remain perceptually realistic.",
  "evidence": "Page 149, Section 3.2 (Transformation and Mutation): \"In order to keep the semantics of the mutants close to the original seed, we adopt a conservative strategy that selects the Affine Transformation to be used only once ... A Pixel Value Transformation can be used multiple times ... we use L0 and L∞ to constrain the pixel-level changes.\"; (Alg.2 / Definition 5 / Eq.2) Page 150: \"For sequential mutations that include an Affine Transformation ... the L0 and L∞ between s0 and sn are computed as follows: L0(s0,sn) = L0(s0,sj-1) + L0(sj,sn)  L∞(s0,sn) = MAX(L∞(s0,sj-1), L∞(sj,sn)).\"; Page 151, Section 4 (User Study Settings): \"For each dataset, we randomly select 30 images as the seeds and generate 5,000 images with each of the 3 mutation strategies. Finally, 9 sets, with a total of 45,000 test images ... We recruit 9 participants ... A generated image is marked invalid if it either could not be perceived, or is recognized as a different class compared with its original counterpart.\"; Page 153, Section 5.1 (RQ1 Results) and Table 2: \"Table 2: The number and ratio of invalid images generated by different mutation strategies ... DeepHunter 60 (1.2%) 145 (2.9%) 40 (0.8%)\"; Page 147 (Abstract / Summary of results): \"The user study on mutation strategies shows ... with careful transformation constraint design and tuning, it can still reduce the likelihood to generate invalid tests to some extent (e.g., DeepHunter generates 1.2% on MNIST, 2.0% on CIFAR-10, and 0.8% on ImageNet).\""
