  "why": "The paper demonstrates that TensorFuzz is primarily used to uncover model robustness and correctness errors. The experiments focus on three types of failures: 1) numerical errors (e.g., finding inputs that cause NaN values), 2) prediction inconsistencies (e.g., finding inputs where a model and its quantized version disagree), and 3) implementation bugs (e.g., surfacing issues in loss function implementations). These examples align directly with the definition of 'Low' severity, as they concern robustness and consistency rather than unsafe behavior or the bypassing of explicit safety mechanisms. The paper does not provide any examples of uncovering unsafe, biased, or toxic outputs, nor does it test models with explicit safety alignments or security defenses.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 6, \"TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions\": \"We then compared the predictions of the 32-bit and the 16-bit model on the MNIST test set and found 0 disagreements... With these settings, the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried. Thus, CGF allowed us to find real errors that could have occured at test time.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 6, \"TensorFuzz can efficiently find numerical errors in trained neural networks\": \"We focus on finding inputs that result in not-a-number (NaN) values... As shown in Figure 2, TensorFuzz found NaNs quickly across 10 different random initializations.\"\n\nPage 8, Section 6, \"TensorFuzz can find real bugs in popular model implementations\": \"TensorFuzz was able to quickly find a satsifying input. The input was one in which the output of the discriminator had too high a magnitude, which caused the incorrectly implemented loss function to have saturating gradients.\""
