  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate or demonstrate attack transferability. All test-case generation and evaluation are performed per-target model (seed inputs are mutated into tests for that same model), and the experiments measure adversarial/backdoor discovery rates per model rather than reusing fault-inducing inputs generated on a surrogate to test other models. The paper also does not describe any fuzzing design or mechanisms aimed at producing inputs intended to transfer across different model implementations performing the same task.",
  "evidence": "Page 1197, Section VI (Algorithm 1 / Test generation): \"The test suite T is initialized with T0, a corpus of seed inputs (Line 1). New test cases are generated by mutating seed inputs. It keeps the traceability of test cases via a mapping orig that maps each test case generated back to its seed origin.\" \n\nPage 1201, Section VII-C (Detecting RNN Defects): \"As shown in Table V, adversarial samples rate and number of unique adversarial samples in the generated test suite are two important indicators for the robustness evaluation. ... For a set of trained models, we pursue the model, the test suite of which contains less amount of adversarial samples and unique adversarial samples.\" \n\nPage 1202–1203, Section VII-F (Comparison With State-of-the-Art Testing Methods): \"We start from 100 seeds drawn from training set and generate 100 000 test cases by DeepStellar and TESTRNN, respectively. The test suites are evaluated for the coverage rate and number of adversarial samples.\" \n\n(These quoted passages show the paper's testing/generation and evaluation are carried out per model/seed and report per-model adversarial/backdoor findings; the paper contains no experimental description or results where fault-inducing inputs crafted on one (surrogate) model are reused to test other models, nor any described mechanisms explicitly aimed at discovering transferable attacks.)"
