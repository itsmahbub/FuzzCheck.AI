  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input-plausibility via explicit, rule-based domain constraints that are applied during gradient-based mutation (the authors describe modifying gradients so each iteration preserves constraints and give concrete image/file constraints). This shows the fuzzing design actively restricts mutations to remain realistic at each mutation step. However, the paper does not provide any empirical, task-specific or human evaluation of the final fault-inducing inputs’ perceptual or semantic realism (no human study or quantitative perceptual measures such as LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity are reported). Because the work enforces plausibility through bounded / rule-based constraints during mutation but does not report explicit empirical validation of final-input realism, the appropriate rating is Medium.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.2 (Domain-specific constraints), p. 6: \"One important aspect of the optimization process is that the generated test inputs need to satisfy several domain-specific constraints to be physically realistic... Our algorithm ensures this property by modifying the gradient дrad (line 13 in Algorithm 1) such that xi+1 = xi + s · дrad still satisfies the constraints (s is the step size in the gradient ascent).\" \n\nSection 6.2 (Domain-specific constraints), p. 9: \"DeepXplore used three different types of constraints for simulating different environment conditions of images: (1) lighting effects for simulating different intensities of lights, (2) occlusion by a single small rectangle for simulating an attacker potentially blocking some parts of a camera, and (3) occlusion by multiple tiny black rectangles for simulating effects of dirt on camera lens... The first constraint restricts image modifications so that DeepXplore can only make the image darker or brighter without changing its content. Specifically, the modification can only increase or decrease all pixel values by the same amount...\" \n\nSection 7 (Results), p. 10: \"For the experimental results shown in Figure 8, we apply three domain-specific constraints (lighting effects, occlusion by a single rectangle, and occlusion by multiple rectangles) as described in §6.2.\" \n\n(Absence of empirical perceptual evaluation) The evaluation (Sections 7 and 7.2, pp. 10–13) reports neuron coverage, counts of difference-inducing inputs, runtimes, and retraining accuracy improvements, but contains no human-subject study or quantitative perceptual/linguistic measures (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS, PESQ, STOI, Perplexity) assessing whether final fault-inducing inputs remain perceptually/semantically realistic."
