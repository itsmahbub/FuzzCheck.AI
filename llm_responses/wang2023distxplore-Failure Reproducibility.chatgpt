  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper primarily applies semantic-preserving metamorphic image transformations (translation, rotation, brightness, etc.) as mutation operators and constrains those transformations for validity, but it does not explicitly account for serialization effects (quantization, rounding, clipping) nor does it state that inputs are generated in serialized formats. According to the metric, metamorphic transformations provide only partial enforcement of failure reproducibility when serialization effects are not explicitly handled; therefore DistXplore matches the 'Medium' level.",
  "evidence": "Page 71, Section 3.2 \"Distribution-Guided Test Generation\": \"In this paper, we mainly focus on image classification tasks. DistXplore can be easily extended to other domains. We select the diverse image transformations (e.g., translation, rotation, brightness) used in DeepTest [54] and DeepHunter [63]. For each selected gene, the mutation randomly selects a transformation function to mutate it. To guarantee the validity of the generated inputs, we adopt the conservative strategy [63] that constrains the transformation...\" \n\nPage 71, Algorithm 1 / 3.2: \"A uniform crossover is performed between the selected two chromosomes in the input level, i.e., genes in a chromosome are inputs of the model. Each gene in the chromosome can be selected to mutate with a selection probability...\" \n\nPage 72, Section 4.1.1 \"Implementation\": \"We have implemented DistXplore in Python 3.6 based on DL framework Keras (ver.2.3.1) with TensorFlow (ver.1.15.2).\" \n\n(Throughout Sections 3 and 4 the paper describes mutation as in-memory transformations on image tensors and constraining transformations for validity, but it contains no discussion of serialization, quantization, rounding, clipping, saving to common storage formats (PNG/JPEG), or generating inputs directly in serialized formats.)"
