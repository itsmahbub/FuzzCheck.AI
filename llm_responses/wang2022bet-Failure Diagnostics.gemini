  "why": "The paper's evaluation focuses exclusively on the efficiency and effectiveness of its method (BET) in discovering error-inducing inputs. The performance is measured using quantitative metrics such as the number of errors found (Err-Num), the diversity of misclassified labels (Label-Num), and the success rate (SR) of finding at least one error. The paper does not provide any diagnostic analysis of the discovered failures. There is no investigation into observable model internals (as it is a black-box method) or any statistical analysis of failure patterns to understand why the models fail. The paper does not attempt to link the discovered failures to underlying model vulnerabilities like dataset bias, overfitting, or spurious features. In fact, the 'Discussion' section explicitly identifies the development of new metrics to \"understand the inner status of the target models\" by analyzing the discovered failures as future work, confirming the absence of such diagnostics in the current study.",
  "evidence": "Page 12, Section 5, \"Novel metrics in black-box testing\": \"White-box model testing methods focus on fully exploring various internal states of target models [19]. ... But this metric is not suitable for black-box testing methods since testers cannot try to improve the neuron coverage without any inner knowledge of the neurons. Thus, we need new metrics for black-box testing methods to understand the inner status of the target models during the test. We think this challenge may be solved through learning or knowledge extraction from the error-inducing inputs acquired during the test. Thus, we list our second future work, i.e., specifying a new metric to reflect the inner states of target models for black-box testing.\""
