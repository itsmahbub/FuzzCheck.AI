  "why": "The BET method explicitly implements a tunable objective function that optimizes for particular class labels and can be driven to enter the decision boundary of a specified label. The paper describes both a DT objective (which includes an explicit per-label term C(x)[li] and per-label query budgets) and an ST objective SOF(x)=C(x)[li], allows dynamic / user-specified prioritization of labels (including ad-hoc risk-driven priorities), and states that when the objective targets a specific label the testing process is led to generate error-inducing inputs with that corresponding label. These design choices steer exploration toward predefined target outcomes (specific labels), meeting the metric's definition of supporting targeted attack discovery.",
  "evidence": "Page 167, Section 3.3 Tunable Objective Function: \"If the objective function targets a specific label, the testing process will be led to enter the decision boundary of this specific label to explore corner cases, i.e., generate error-inducing inputs with the corresponding label.\"\n\nPage 167, Section 3.3 (Tunable objective function for ST): \"SOF(x) = C(x)[li]\" (where li is the selected label to optimize).\n\nPage 167, Section 3.3 (label ordering / prioritization): \"We prioritize labels that are prone to be vulnerable... We also allow users to prioritize labels as they want to support ad-hoc testing cases. For example... it is more risky if an ordinary employee is misclassified as a manager... users may prioritize finding error-inducing inputs that would be misclassified as managers.\""
