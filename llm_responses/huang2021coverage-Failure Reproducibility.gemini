  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's methodology partially addresses failure reproducibility by ensuring mutations are valid in their respective data domains, but it does not explicitly enforce or verify that failures persist after a full serialization/deserialization cycle. For continuous image data (MNIST), the mutation process includes a step to \"round off the decimals around 0 and 1 to make the pixel value stay within the value range,\" which partially accounts for I/O effects like clipping and quantization. For discrete data like text (IMDB) and chemical representations (Lipophilicity), the paper employs specialized toolkits (EDA and RDKit) that generate valid outputs, which can be considered a form of semantic-preserving transformation. However, the test oracle evaluates the mutated input directly from its in-memory representation without a described serialization step to confirm the failure's persistence. This combination of applying transformations that consider data validity but lacking explicit I/O verification in the oracle aligns with the 'Medium' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section VII-A, \"Input Mutation\": \"For MNIST model, we add Gaussian noise to input image and round off the decimals around 0 and 1 to make the pixel value stay within the value range.\"\nPage 9, Section VII-A, \"Input Mutation\": \"To avoid this, we take a set M of mutants from the EDA toolkit [48]... This ensures the mutated text paragraphs are always valid.\"\nPage 9, Section VII-A, \"Input Mutation\": \"For Lipophilicity model, we take a set M of mutants that change the SMILES string without affecting the molecular structure it represents... The enumerated SMILES strings are the test cases.\"\nPage 8, Section VII-C, \"Test Oracle\": The oracle's definition relies on comparing the in-memory mutated input `x'` to the original input `x` without mentioning a serialization step: \"A test case x' is said to not pass the oracle if x' is within the norm-ball of some known sample x, i.e., ||x - x'||2 ≤ roracle, and if x' has a different classification from x, i.e., p(x) ≠ φ(x').\""
