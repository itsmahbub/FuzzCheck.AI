  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The failures DeepCruiser uncovers are transcription/misprediction errors in ASR (measured as increased WER/CER) produced by metamorphic audio mutations and coverage-guided generation. The paper's evaluation and research questions focus on increasing coverage and triggering erroneous transcriptions (higher WER). There is no presentation or evaluation of bypassing explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms, nor any examples of inducing high-severity security behaviors (e.g., jailbreaks, data leakage, unauthorized actions, or toxic/harmful outputs). Therefore the failures reported are robustness errors (mispredictions) rather than high- or medium-severity safety/security violations.",
  "evidence": "Page 13, Section 6.2 Coverage-Guided Testing: \"If the prediction result is inconsistent with the original seed, a' will be added into the failed tests. For audio in ASR, we decide a failed test by checking whether the Word/Character Error Rate (W/CER) exceeds a certain threshold.\"; Page 16, Section 7.3 (RQ2): \"We sample 100 audio from the test data whose Word Error Rates (WERs) are 0. The WER of the audio represents the error rate for the transcripts from RNN. ... Based on the 100 audio (seeds), we randomly generate 10,000 audio (with different WER) by metamorphic transformations.\"; Page 19, Section 7.5 (Answer to RQ4): \"Answer to RQ4: DeepCruiser can effectively generate tests to trigger erroneous behaviors of the RNN. For more fine-grained abstract model, it will capture more erroneous behaviors (i.e., higher WER) of the RNN.\""
