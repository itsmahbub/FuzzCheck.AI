  "why": "The paper's method generates audio test cases from a real-world text corpus using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. It incorporates a mechanism to enforce input plausibility by filtering the generated audio. Specifically, an audio file is considered a 'valid test case' only if at least one of the multiple Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems used for cross-referencing can transcribe it correctly. This step is explicitly designed to discard 'invalid audios synthesized by the TTS system,' which serves as a proxy for filtering out unintelligible or unrealistic speech. However, the paper does not provide any additional empirical validation of the plausibility of the final fault-inducing audio inputs, such as through human evaluation or by reporting quantitative speech quality metrics (e.g., PESQ, STOI). The method enforces plausibility during the test case generation and filtering process but lacks a final, explicit assessment of the resulting inputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section II.A, paragraph 1: \"The tool cross-references the outputs of these ASR systems and tags the synthesized audio-text pair as a valid test case if at least one of the ASR systems can successfully transcribe the audio (i.e., each word in the transcription matches each corresponding word in the input text). A valid test case can be either a failed test case or a successful test case... We take the audio-text pair as an indeterminable test case if none of them can successfully transcribe the audio.\"\nThis quote describes the filtering mechanism that ensures a baseline level of intelligibility for an input to be considered 'valid', thus enforcing a form of plausibility. The paper lacks any further assessment beyond this."
