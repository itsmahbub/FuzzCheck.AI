  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly constrains mutations to semantically valid parameter ranges (manually tuned domain boundaries), encodes those bounds as the search sub-space for the metaheuristics, limits the number of affine transformations per mutation (a conservative strategy to avoid unrealistic images), and applies an SSIM-based filter that rejects mutated inputs whose similarity to the original falls below a tuned threshold. These mechanisms are described as applied to each generated mutated input (i.e., they check semantic equivalence to the original), which enforces input plausibility throughout the iterative generation process rather than only between successive mutation steps.",
  "evidence": "Section IV.A (Metamorphic Transformation), p. 455: \"Because each image-based transformation has a theoretical domain, which defines the interval of possible values of its parameters such as brightness factor or rotation angle θ, when applying transformations, we need to take into account these domain boundaries to ensure that transformed inputs are semantically equivalent to the original ones. To infer the valid domain interval of each transformation’s parameters, we manually tune them to set up the appropriate range of values, i.e., high and low boundaries, that preserves the input semantics before and after each transformation, with respect to the data distribution.\" \n\nSection IV.A (same), p. 455: \"We opted for this conservative strategy that consists of applying only one affine transformation following the pixel-value transformations because applying multiple affine transformations at once would increase the chances of generating meaningless images, i.e., images that don’t occur in real-world situations.\" \n\nSection IV.A (same), p. 455: \"To verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original inputs, we compute a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) ... Therefore, we reject mutated synthetic inputs for which SSIM values are lower than a tuned threshold.\" \n\nSection IV.C (Swarm-based Metaheuristics), p. 456: \"To ensure semantically preserving transformations, we use the valid domain intervals of transformations that we have already tuned manually to create the high and low boundaries vectors, defining the sub-space of exploration.\" \n\nSection VI (Threats to Validity), p. 457: \"The manual tuning of metamorphic transformations’ domain and the threshold of SSIM could affect the validity of our results. To mitigate this threat, we selected a sample of our generated images ... and verified them manually. We found them to be correct.\""
