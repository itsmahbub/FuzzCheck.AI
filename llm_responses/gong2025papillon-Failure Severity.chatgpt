  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper proposes an automated black-box jailbreaking framework whose explicit goal is to bypass aligned models' safety mechanisms and elicit harmful outputs. The authors evaluate PAPILLON against safety-aligned/proprietary models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-Pro) and test its resiliency against specific defenses (perplexity filters, SmoothLLM, Llama Guard, and hybrid defenses), reporting high attack success rates even when defenses are enabled. This directly matches the metric's definition of high-severity failures: bypassing explicit safety/policy mechanisms to induce jailbreaks and unsafe outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 2401, Abstract: \"we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework...\"; Page 2406, Section 3 Threat Model: \"The target LLM is assumed to be an aligned model, fine-tuned with instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which typically refuses to respond to unethical or harmful questions.\"; Page 2406, Section 3 Threat Model: \"The objective of the attack is to craft jailbreak prompts ... 1) To circumvent the safety mechanisms of the target LLM, ensuring that it responds to a harmful query instead of opting not to answer.\"; Page 2412, Section 6 Resiliency against Defenses and Table 6 (results): show PAPILLON retains high ASR against defenses (e.g., \"GPT-4: PAPILLON 80% → After Llama Guard 64%\" in Table 6); Page 2412, Table 7 (hybrid defenses): show PAPILLON maintains high ASR under combined defenses (e.g., \"GPT-4: PAPILLON 80% → Perplexity + SmoothLLM 80%\")."
