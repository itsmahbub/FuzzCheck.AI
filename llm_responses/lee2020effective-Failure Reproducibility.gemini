  "why": "The paper proposes a white-box testing method, ADAPT, which generates new test inputs by adding the gradient of selected neurons to an existing input's numerical representation. This process directly manipulates the in-memory floating-point values of the input tensor. The paper specifies that a constraint is applied to the generated inputs, but this constraint is a numerical L2-distance to the original input, which does not account for serialization effects like quantization, rounding, or clipping. The methodology described in Algorithm 2 and the experimental setup does not include any step to save the generated adversarial inputs to a standard file format (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and then reload them to verify if the failure persists. The entire process of mutation and evaluation appears to be performed on in-memory tensors, ignoring potential I/O effects. Consequently, the fault-inducing perturbations are likely fragile numerical artifacts that could be lost or altered by standard serialization.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.1, \"Experimental Setup\": \"All the techniques, including ADAPT, performed testing while maintaining the L2-distance between the initial and mutated inputs within 0.05 on average.\" This shows the constraint is purely numerical and does not address I/O effects.\nPage 5, Algorithm 2, Lines 14-16: The algorithm generates a new input `I'` via gradient addition, immediately runs the DNN on it (`O' ← Run(DNN, I')`), and then checks for new coverage (`if Cov(O') ...`). This workflow contains no intermediate step to account for serialization or I/O operations, indicating that evaluation is performed on the raw numerical output of the mutation."
