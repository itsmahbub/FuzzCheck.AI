  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper incorporates substantial per-mutation plausibility controls—scoping mutations to known entities, enforcing preconditions on the interpretation, parameterizing edits with real extracted entities, and performing rule-based conformity checks (perspective, lighting, road placement) before accepting each mutated input. However, it does not address the possibility of cumulative drift over multiple sequential mutations: all experiments apply only a single semantic edit per test, and the authors explicitly note remaining conformity gaps (e.g., missing shadows, perspective mismatches, occlusions) and the failure of a learned discriminator to reliably filter out implausible images. Thus, the approach enforces plausibility between immediate parent and child inputs but does not guarantee that inputs would remain realistic under iterative chaining, fitting the “Medium” rating.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 (pp. 1960): “First, we scope the space of all mutations Δ… Second, we associate a set of preconditions Prec with each mutation δ… Third, we enable the parameterization of δ_r to employ real sensor data to increase the likelihood of conformity.”\n\nFigure 5 (p. 1961): shows a mandatory “Conformity Check” after each mutation and before accepting a test.\n\nSection 4.4.4 (p. 1963): “We explored…training a binary classifier… The discriminator learned to differentiate between the classes, but could not differentiate conforming versus nonconforming images.”\n\nSection 4.3 (pp. 1962–1963) and Section 6.4 (p. 1967, Table 2): discuss remaining non-conformities (shadows, overlaps, lighting) and a substantial false-positive rate, indicating that plausibility is not fully preserved.\n\nThroughout the paper, only single-step mutations are generated and evaluated—no mechanism enforces plausibility across multiple chained mutations."
