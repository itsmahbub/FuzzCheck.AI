  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "ASDF applies rule-based, realism-preserving transformations (e.g., tense changes, homophone substitutions using WordHoard to obtain real example sentences) and explicitly filters transformed inputs via cross-referencing (a transformed text must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR to be kept). These mechanisms enforce plausibility between successive mutation steps. However, the paper does not describe any mechanism that bounds or monitors cumulative drift across multiple fuzzing iterations (no per-seed similarity/bounded-magnitude guarantee over repeated transformations), and it acknowledges limitations of TTS realism. Therefore plausibility is enforced between steps but cumulative effects across iterations are not addressed.",
  "evidence": "Page 461, Section II (Tool Design): \"In this iteration, a text transformer will mutate the texts of the failed test cases, effectively generating one or more transformed test cases to be appended to the corpus.\" Page 462, Section III (Core Functionalities): \"The Homophone Transformation method first identifies the homophone of the error-inducing term of the failed test case. Subsequently, a new example sentence that contains that homophone is obtained through the WordHoard Python library [22]. This new sentence will be used as the new test case.\" Page 462, Section IV (Usage): \"It is important to note that cross-referencing is used to filter the low-quality, unrealistic texts resulting from text transformation. A transformed text input must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR service to be deemed valid (or determinable); otherwise, it is deemed indeterminable and discarded.\" Page 462-463, Section V (Challenges and Future Work): \"ASDF generates an audio test suite using a TTS library. This assumes that the generated audio is interchangeable with the real-world speech of humans, which may not be the case in real-life situations.\""
