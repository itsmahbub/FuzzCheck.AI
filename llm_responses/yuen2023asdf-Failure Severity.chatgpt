  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper describes ASDF as a differential testing framework that identifies instances where an ASR system's transcription does not match the original text (i.e., mispredictions / transcription errors) and performs phonetic analysis to find error-prone phonemes. The tool's goals, methods, and metrics focus on generating more test cases and measuring transcription failures and phoneme-level weaknesses. The paper contains no description or claim that ASDF is designed to bypass safety, policy, or security mechanisms in defended or safety-aligned models, nor does it report uncovering high-severity behaviors (e.g., jailbreaks, data leakage, unauthorized actions) or testing models with explicit defense/safety mechanisms. Therefore the failures it uncovers correspond to standard robustness/misprediction errors rather than high- or medium-severity safety/security violations.",
  "evidence": "Page 461, I. INTRODUCTION: \"Intuitively, the transcription produced by an ASR system should be equivalent to the text used to generate the audio. Otherwise, a failed test case for an ASR system is uncovered.\"; Page 462, IV. USAGE: \"A failed text is defined as an audio file that is incorrectly transcribed by at least one ASR system.\"; Page 462, III. CORE FUNCTIONALITIES: \"The ASR systems currently available in ASDF are DeepSpeech [19], wav2letter [20], and wav2vec2 [21].\" (tooling described focuses on transcription comparison and phonetic analysis; no sections or quotes describe bypassing defenses, jailbreaks, data leakage, or testing of safety-aligned/defended models)"
