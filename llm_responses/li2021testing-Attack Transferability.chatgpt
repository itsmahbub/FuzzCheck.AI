  "why": "The paper does not demonstrate or evaluate transferability of fault-inducing inputs across models. TACTIC is defined and executed per subject model (the search takes the subject DNN as input and returns critical conditions for that model), and all experiments generate and evaluate critical styles separately for each ADS. There is no experiment that crafts fault-inducing inputs on one surrogate model and reuses them to test other models, nor does the design include explicit mechanisms aimed at finding transferable attacks across different model implementations.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section 3.3 \"Search of Critical Environmental Conditions\": \"TACTIC receives as inputs the subject DNN-based ADS N, the MUNIT model M trained for the given environmental type, and a set Io of the original driving scenes. The output of TACTIC is a set S of the critical environmental conditions of the given environmental type.\"; Page 4, Section 4.2 \"Comparison with Baselines on Effectiveness - Setup\": \"We execute TACTIC with two coverage-guiding strategies: KMNC (denoted as TACTICKMNC) and NBC (denoted as TACTICNBC), respectively, on each of the three subject DNN-based ADSs, under the five environmental types.\"; Page 4, Section 4.2 \"Setup\" (describing baselines): \"For Rc, when testing the three subject systems, we randomly sample 4 style vectors (equal to the number of critical style vectors generated by TACTIC) for each of the environmental types and separately apply the 4 random style vectors on the Udacity testing dataset to synthesise testing driving scenes...\""
