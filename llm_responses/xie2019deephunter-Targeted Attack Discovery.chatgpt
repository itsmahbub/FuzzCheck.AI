  "why": "DeepHunter is designed to find generic erroneous behaviors (e.g., misclassifications and inconsistencies after metamorphic mutations or quantization) by generating semantically-preserved mutants and checking for prediction changes. The framework’s oracle is metamorphic (it assumes the true label stays the same) and it treats any change in the model’s output on a mutated input as an error. The paper describes no mechanism to steer exploration toward attacker-chosen specific outputs (e.g., force a model to output a particular target label or phrase) or to pursue targeted adversarial objectives; instead the system records inputs that cause the model to disagree with the original prediction or with a quantized variant. Therefore DeepHunter performs untargeted exploration and discovers generic failures rather than supporting targeted attack discovery.",
  "evidence": "Page 149, Section 3.2 Test Oracle: \"Definition 1. Given an ideal human oracle O and a test x of a specific input domain, we define metamorphic mutation M on x, if ∀x' ∈ M(x), we have O(x') = O(x).\"\n\nPage 149, Section 3.2 Transformation and Mutation, Definition 2: \"Given a DNN F, a human oracle O, a metamorphic mutation strategy M and a test x satisfying F(x) = O(x), a mutant x' ∈ M(x) is an erroneous behavior of F if F(x') ≠ F(x).\"\n\nPage 149, Algorithm 1 (DeepHunter test generation): \"for s' ∈ T do if isFailedTest(s', result) then F ← F ∪ {s'} else if isCoverageGain(cov) then Q ← Q.append(s')\" (shows tests are marked 'failed' based on a prediction change/failed oracle, not a targeted output).\n\nPage 147, Introduction (research questions): \"RQ3 (Error Detection): How different are the existing criteria for guiding erroneous behaviors detection? How effective are different seed selection strategies for detecting erroneous behaviors of DNNs?\" (paper frames testing goal as detecting erroneous behaviors rather than steering to attacker-chosen outputs)."
