  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process using a two-fold approach. First, it employs a ROUGE-1 score as a strict quality filter to ensure that any generated question maintains high semantic similarity to its parent seed, thereby preventing significant semantic drift in a single mutation step. Only questions surpassing a predefined similarity threshold are considered valid. Second, it introduces a 'Perplexity Priority' criterion as a guidance mechanism. This criterion prioritizes adding questions with higher 'authenticity and rationality' (i.e., lower perplexity) back into the seed pool for subsequent fuzzing iterations. This combination of a direct filter on generated inputs and a guiding principle for the evolution of the seed corpus ensures that the test cases remain within a plausible distribution of grammatically correct and semantically coherent questions.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2.5, Quality Assessment: \"To ensure the quality of generated questions, we employ the ROUGE-1 metric [35] to evaluate the questions generated by metamorphic transformations... for a given original question q and the corresponding transformed question q', the ROUGE-1 score can be calculated...\" This is implemented in Algorithm 1 (Page 4) which states: \"if quality_score > τ then // acceptable D.append(s');\".\n\nPage 6, Section 3.3.2, Perplexity Priority: \"To ensure that the generated test questions have good authenticity and rationality, we consider applying perplexity priority as guidance for seed data retention.\""
