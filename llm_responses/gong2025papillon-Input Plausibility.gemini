  "why": "The paper's method, PAPILLON, is explicitly designed to enforce input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process. It critiques existing methods that produce \"nonsensical or meaningless sequences\" and proposes a solution that maintains semantic coherence. Instead of using low-level mutations that can accumulate and lead to unrealistic inputs, PAPILLON employs an LLM helper to perform high-level, semantically-grounded mutations like 'Role-play' and 'Contextualization'. This ensures that the generated jailbreak prompts are consistently fluent, meaningful, and natural-sounding, thus remaining within a plausible input distribution for LLMs. The paper further substantiates this by showing that its generated prompts have low perplexity and can bypass perplexity-based defenses, which are designed to filter out implausible inputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.1, 'Mutation': \"In PAPILLON, we design three novel question-dependent mutation strategies capable of generating mutations with semantic meaning and limited token length by leveraging the power of an LLM helper. As a result, we can significantly improve attack performance and reduce attack costs.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 4.2, 'Maintain semantic coherence': \"Ensuring that the generated adversarial prompts are readable (low perplexity) is crucial for evading existing jailbreak defenses based on perplexity filters. In this paper, we propose using GPT-driven mutation operators to create jailbreaking templates, allowing us to preserve the semantic integrity of the generated templates throughout the mutation process.\""
