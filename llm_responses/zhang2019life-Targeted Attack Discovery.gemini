  "why": "The paper's method, LipFuzzer, is designed for targeted attack discovery. Its explicit goal is to identify voice commands that are misinterpreted by a Voice Assistant's Intent Classifier to invoke a specific, attacker-chosen, malicious vApp instead of the intended legitimate one. This is known as a 'vApp squatting attack'. The fuzzing process is not untargeted; it starts with seed commands for legitimate vApps and uses linguistic models to generate mutations that are likely to be confused with a predefined target (the malicious vApp's invocation phrase). The oracle for success is whether the mutated command successfully triggers the unintended, malicious vApp. This directly aligns with the 'High' rating's definition of steering exploration toward specific, predefined target outcomes (i.e., invoking a specific malicious application).",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section C. Motivating Example: \"To better understand how Intent Classifier relates to the speech misinterpretation, we show an example of vApp squatting attacks... In this example, a maliciously uploaded vApp aims to hijack the victim vApp when users try to install the victim vApp. The correct form of installation voice command should be 'Alexa, install The True Bank Skill'. An adversary intentionally crafted his/her vApp with a confusing name of 'The Truth Bank Skill'. As a result, as shown in Figure 3, a new leaf node of 'truth' is injected into the intent classification tree. Thus, if a user accidentally speaks 'Alexa, install The Truth Bank Skill', the malicious vApp will be installed and executed...\" This example clearly illustrates a targeted attack where the goal is to have a specific malicious vApp installed."
