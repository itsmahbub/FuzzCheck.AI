  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight into the discovered failures by correlating their occurrence with an observable model internal: neuronal coverage. The entire approach is premised on the idea that increasing neuronal coverage will lead to the discovery of more erroneous behaviors. The evaluation section explicitly analyzes this connection, stating that generating inputs geared towards improving coverage triggers more internal states of the DNN, which leads to a higher chance of detecting defects. This constitutes an analysis of failure patterns through their correlation with a model internal metric, which fits the 'Medium' criteria. The paper does not, however, extend this analysis to explain the failures in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities like non-robust features or dataset bias, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 457, Section V-C, 'RQ2: Detection of DNN Erroneous Behaviors': '...it indicates that generating synthetic test inputs towards improving the neuronal coverage could trigger more states of a DNN, incurring higher chances of defect detection, which is consistent with the practical purpose of testing criteria used in traditional software testing. [...] This result suggests that DeepEvolution is capable of obtaining adversarial inputs for each original input and that the local coverage level integrated in the fitness function plays an important role in assessing how much the DNN’s state of the transformed input is different from the state that resulted from the original input.'"
