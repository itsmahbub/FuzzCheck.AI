  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs a mechanism, \"GAN-based Fidelity Assurance\", to enforce input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process. This component uses a discriminator, trained to distinguish between real and synthetic data, to filter out mutated inputs that are not semantically similar to the original data distribution. This ensures that generated inputs remain plausible during the fuzzing iterations. Furthermore, the paper provides direct empirical evidence of the effectiveness of this mechanism through a human evaluation. In an ablation study, two authors manually assessed the fidelity of 100 inputs generated with and without the GAN filter. The study found that 86% of inputs from the proposed method (DRFuzz) were high-fidelity, compared to only 57.5% from the variant without the GAN filter (DRFuzz_NG). This combination of a dedicated plausibility enforcement mechanism and empirical validation via human study aligns perfectly with the 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section IV-B2, \"Contribution of the main component of DRFuzz\": \"We further manually evaluate the fidelity of inputs obtained with and without the fidelity assurance mechanism. Specifically, we sample 100 inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG and DRFuzz, respectively, and two authors manually evaluate their fidelity individually. The Cohen’s Kappa coefficient between their evaluation is 0.67. They label 86% of inputs generated by DRFuzz as high-fidelity and only 57.5% of inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG as high-fidelity. This indicates that the GAN-based Fidelity Assurance technique can filter out more than 20% of fault-triggering inputs with low fidelity.\""
