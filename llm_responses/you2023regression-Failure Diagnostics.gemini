  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper provides a detailed diagnostic analysis of the discovered regression faults, linking them to underlying model vulnerabilities. It conducts a statistical analysis of failure patterns, identifying classes with a high concentration of regression faults. Crucially, it explicitly interprets these patterns as potential indicators of \"overfitting\" and \"bias\" introduced during the model evolution process. Furthermore, it uses Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (heatmaps) to visualize and analyze the input features that contribute to specific failures, connecting the failures to different feature dependencies. This combination of statistical pattern analysis and causal explanation in terms of overfitting, bias, and feature reliance meets the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section IV-B, \"Regression Explication based on DRFuzz\": \"We further focus on utilizing regression faults (#RF) to explain the bias and risks induced in the regression process. For clarity of illustration, we select and report the results on subjects of MNIST-LeNet5... From Figure 3(a), we can observe that Classes 7, 8, and 4 contain the most regression faults, which means that the regression process may induce overfitting in these classes... The prediction results and the faulty behaviors facilitate explaining the bias (such as overfitting) in each class to judge if the regression process contributes to data relevance.\"\nPage 10, Section V-B, \"Diversity Analysis\": \"To assist the visual analysis, we use the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map (heatmap) [61] to visualize the importance of each feature in the prediction process... The phenomena above show that different faulty behaviors may be caused by different features...\""
