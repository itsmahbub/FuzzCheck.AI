  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper contains no experiments or claims that fault-inducing inputs found on one model were reused to test other models for the same task, nor does CureFuzz include design elements aimed at producing transferable attacks across different model implementations. The evaluation applies CureFuzz separately to multiple SDMs and uses found scenarios to repair the same model (fine-tuning + re-test), but it does not measure whether seeds discovered on a surrogate transfer to unseen targets or test multiple implementations with the same seeds.",
  "evidence": "Introduction (quote): \"We evaluate CureFuzz by applying it to well-known SDMs that use various learning algorithms. ... The experimental results demonstrate that CureFuzz effectively and efficiently identifies a significant number of catastrophic failures across all considered SDMs.\" (Introduction) — shows per-model evaluation but no claim of cross-model reuse.\n\nSection 5, RQ3 (quote): \"we utilize CureFuzz again to test the newly fine-tuned SDM. For the repaired ACAS Xu, 55 faults and 4 distinct types of crash-triggering scenarios are detected. We find that the crashes found by CureFuzz are reduced by 73% compared with the original DNN model.\" (Section 5, RQ3) — demonstrates using found scenarios to repair and retest the same model, not transfer to other models.\n\nSection 4.1 Research Questions (quote): \"To evaluate the performance of CureFuzz and comprehensively understand the impact, we formulate the three research questions: RQ1: How effective is CureFuzz in finding crash-triggering scenarios? RQ2: Can CureFuzz be effectively guided with the curiosity mechanism? RQ3: Can we use the crashes found by CureFuzz to improve SDMs?\" (Section 4.1) — the listed RQs do not include any question about transferability of fault-inducing inputs across different model implementations."
