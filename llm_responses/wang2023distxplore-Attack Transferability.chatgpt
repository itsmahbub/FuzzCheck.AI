  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate or demonstrate attack transferability across models. DistXplore formulates and optimizes test suites using distributions measured on a target model's internal layer outputs (the logits) and the evaluation and robustness enhancement steps retrain or test the same model on which test suites were generated. The experiments run the method separately on multiple models/datasets, but the paper does not reuse fault-inducing inputs crafted on one (surrogate) model to test other models, nor does it describe any mechanism intended to discover or promote attacks that transfer across different model implementations.",
  "evidence": "• Section 3.1.1 (page 71, \"Model Evaluation\"): \"The distribution difference is measured on a specific layer of the DNN. In this paper, we select the logits layer, i.e., the layer before the softmax layer...\" (shows method depends on internal layer outputs of the target model).\n\n• Section 4.1.4 (page 73, \"Configuration of DistXplore\"): \"For each class, we run DistXplore multiple times ... Finally, for each model, we run DistXplore 90 times (i.e., 10 source classes × 9 target classes).\" (shows runs are per-model; no cross-model reuse is described).\n\n• Section 4.2.3 (page 75, \"RQ3: Robustness Enhancement\"): \"For each tool, we fine-tune the original model 20 epochs ... by adding the new data generated from each tool, and evaluate the empirical robustness of the new model on the validation dataset.\" (shows generated tests are used to retrain/evaluate the same model rather than testing other models).\n\n• Section 3.1.2 (page 71, \"Model Enhancement\"): description of target selection and distribution diversity refers to selecting other classes as targets (inter-class guidance), not other models or surrogate-model attacks: \"We select the classes in the same task as targets because the classification is based on their relationships...\".\n\nThere is no text in the paper that (a) states that fault-inducing inputs generated on one model were reused to test other models, (b) measures cross-model transfer of discovered faults, or (c) proposes mechanisms specifically designed to produce inputs intended to transfer across different model implementations."
