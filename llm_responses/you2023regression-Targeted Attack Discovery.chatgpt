  "why": "The paper's goal and design focus on discovering regression faults defined as inputs where the prior version is correct and the new version is incorrect (i.e., amplifying prediction differences between versions). DRFuzz steers exploration toward increasing prediction-probability differences and improving diversity/fidelity of detected faults, but it does not aim to induce specific attacker-chosen outputs or explicitly target a predefined target label/phrase. The mutation-selection reward and oracle are based on generic prediction-difference and fidelity metrics rather than a user-specified target output, so the approach performs untargeted exploration of regression faults rather than targeted attack discovery.",
  "evidence": "p.82, Abstract: \"we propose a novel regression fuzzing technique called DRFuzz, which facilitates generating inputs that trigger diverse regression faults and have high fidelity.\" \n\np.83, Section II. DEFINITION (Regression fault): \"x is called to trigger a regression fault if x is correctly predicted by M1, yet wrongly predicted by M2, i.e., cM1[x] = y ∧ cM2[x] ≠ y.\" \n\np.84, Section III-A (Diversity Measurement): \"DRFuzz adopts the tuple [ta0, (cM1[tai] → cM2[tai])] to approximately distinguish the fault triggering inputs and uses the tuple diversity to represent the diversity of the fault-triggering inputs.\" \n\np.85, Section III-C (Heuristic-based Regression Fuzzing Process): \"we expect that in each iteration, the new test input generated through mutation can produce a larger prediction difference (measured by the prediction probability difference in each class) between versions than that produced by the test input before mutation.\" \n\np.85, Section III-C (Mutation Rule Selection, Formula (2)): \"Reward = #DiffTriggerInputs / #TotalSelect × #FidelInputs / #TotalSelect\" (shows mutation prioritization is driven by counts of inputs that cause prediction differences and fidelity, not by steering to a specific attacker-chosen output)."
