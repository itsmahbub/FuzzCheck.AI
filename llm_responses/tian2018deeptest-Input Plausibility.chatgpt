  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "DeepTest explicitly restricts individual mutation steps to realistic, domain-specific image transformations (brightness, contrast, affine transforms, blur, rain/fog composed with Photoshop filters) and specifies bounded parameter ranges (Table 4). It also applies a quantitative filter (Equation 3) and manual inspection to reduce implausible / false-positive reports, i.e., it validates plausibility of final fault-inducing inputs. However, the fuzzing algorithm (Algorithm 1) composes multiple transformations without an explicit mechanism that enforces plausibility across cumulative iterations (no distributional constraint or perceptual-similarity metric is enforced during generation), and the authors acknowledge that generated images “may not be exactly reproducible in reality.” Thus DeepTest validates final inputs and constrains single-step mutations, but it does not fully prevent or measure cumulative drift with perceptual metrics or a human study, matching the paper to the Medium level.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 (p.306): \"we investigate nine different realistic image transformations (changing brightness, changing contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, blurring, fog effect, and rain effect).\"; Table 4 (p.306): lists bounded parameter ranges for each transformation (e.g., Translation (tx, ty) (10, 10) to (100, 100) step (10, 10); Rotation q 3 to 30 with step 3; Contrast α 1.2 to 3.0 step 0.2; Brightness β 10 to 100 step 10), showing per-step constraints; Algorithm 1 (Section 3.3, p.307): shows composition of transformations across iterations (e.g., \"Randomly pick parameter P1 for T1 ... newImage = ApplyTransforms(image, T1, P1, T2, P2)\"), indicating cumulative mutation without an explicit plausibility-enforcing constraint across iterations; Section 3.4 (p.309–310): defines metamorphic oracle and filtering: \"(ˆθi − θt_i)^2 ≤ λ MSEorig\" (Eqn.2) and the filtration criterion \"| MSE(trans,param) − MSEorig | ≤ ϵ (3)\" and states \"Thus, we only choose the transformations that obey Equation 3 for counting erroneous behaviors.\" — this is a quantitative validation/filter applied to final inputs; Section 6 Threats to Validity (p.311): \"DeepTest generates realistic synthetic images by applying different image transformations on the seed images. However, these transformations are not designed to be exhaustive and therefore may not cover all realistic cases... the generated pictures may not be exactly reproducible in reality due to a large number of unpredictable factors...\"; Section 5 (p.311): \"We also manually checked the bugs reported in Table 8 and report the false positives in Figure 8... all the authors have reviewed the images and agreed on the false positives.\""
