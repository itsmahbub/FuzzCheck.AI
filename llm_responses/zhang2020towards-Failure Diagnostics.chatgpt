  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides substantive diagnostic analysis of failures using observable model-internal uncertainty signals and statistical failure patterns (single-shot PCS and Bayesian multi-shot metrics such as VRO/VR/PE/MI). It systematically characterizes adversarial and benign examples in a PCS–VRO space, identifies common vs. uncommon uncertainty patterns, and quantifies how those patterns affect defense success. However, it does not connect discovered failures to deeper underlying vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious/non-robust features, dataset bias, or overfitting (no neuron-level, layer/position, or coverage-based causal analysis), so it does not meet the \"High\" criterion. This aligns with the metric’s \"Medium\" definition: providing diagnostic insight via analysis of observable internals and statistical failure patterns but not explaining root causes like spurious features or dataset bias.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.740): \"We first investigate the capability of multiple uncertainty metrics in differentiating benign examples (BEs) and AEs, which enables to characterize the uncertainty patterns of input data.\"; Section 3.2 RQ1 (p.743): \"The objective of RQ1 is to study the relationship between uncertainty metrics and adversarial examples. In particular, we analyze the effectiveness of uncertainty metrics in distinguishing AEs and BEs.\"; Section 3.3 Characterizing Data Behavior (p.744): \"Therefore, we adopt a two-dimensional metric, i.e., (PCS, VRO), to characterize the BEs and AEs on a specific DNN model. Based on this, the data is classified into four patterns (see Fig. 2 (a)): low PCS and high VRO (LH), high PCS and high VRO (HH), low PCS and low VRO (LL) and high PCS and low VRO (HL).\"; Section 3.4 Answer to RQ2 (p.746): \"Answer to RQ2: BEs and AEs usually belong to the HL type and LH type, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, testing tools to some extent generate different AEs.\"; Section 5.2 (p.748): \"The overall result shows that the existing defense techniques perform poorly on the uncommon data we generated.\""
