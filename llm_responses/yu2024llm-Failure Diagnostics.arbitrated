  "value": "Low",
  "why": "While the paper presents extensive experimental results (e.g., ASR, EASR, QBC, TBC) and ablation studies on the fuzzer’s components, it does not perform any diagnostic analysis of the models themselves. There is no examination of internal model signals (neuron activations, coverage metrics), nor any statistical analysis linking failure patterns to input structure or underlying vulnerabilities (spurious features, dataset bias, overfitting). The work focuses on *finding* jailbreaks rather than *explaining* why the models fail.",
  "evidence": "Page 4664, Section 4.1 (‘Metrics’): defines ASR, EASR, QBC, TBC—metrics measuring fuzzer performance rather than model diagnostics.  Page 4667, Section 5 (‘Discussion – Limitations’): acknowledges reliance on oracle accuracy but makes no mention of internal model analysis or causal vulnerability explanations."
