  "value": "Low",
  "why": "While the paper reports extensive failure counts (per-ASR and per-TTS) and measures false positive rates, it does not perform diagnostic analysis of the ASR models themselves. There is no examination of model internals (e.g., neuron activations or coverage), nor statistical analysis linking specific input characteristics (such as word classes, sentence length, or phonetic features) to failure patterns. The only root-cause analysis presented (Section IV.B) categorizes false positives in the testing infrastructure (TTS errors, preprocessing quirks, ambiguous audio) rather than uncovering why the ASR models fail. Consequently, the paper merely reports failures without providing the diagnostic insights into underlying model vulnerabilities required for a Medium or High rating.",
  "evidence": "Section IV.B (Analysis of False Positive Failed Test Case from Manual Verification):\n\"We analyze these false positives and observed that they can be categorized into 4 different cases: (1) ... highlights a problem with the TTS; (2) ... indicates a problem with the TTS; (3) ... limitations of our Text Preprocessing step; (4) Audio is ambiguous...\"\n\nNo sections of the paper investigate correlations between input features and ASR failures or analyze model internals (e.g., neuron coverage, layer behavior), nor do they link identified failures to model vulnerabilities such as over-reliance on spurious features or dataset bias."
