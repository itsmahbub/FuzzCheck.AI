  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's contribution and evaluation focus on increasing coverage and finding adversarial inputs (misclassifications) for standard pre-trained models (LeNet, VGG, ResNet). All reported failures are robustness errors (incorrectly classified labels / adversarial images). The authors do not evaluate or claim bypassing of any explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms, nor do they test defended or safety-aligned models or demonstrate jailbreaks, data leakage, or unauthorized actions. Therefore the failures uncovered correspond to model robustness errors only, matching the metric's Low category.",
  "evidence": "Page 165 (Abstract): \"Experiments with real-world network models and datasets show that Adapt is remarkably more effective than existing testing techniques in terms of coverage and adversarial inputs found.\" \n\nPage 172 (Section 4.3, 'Adversarial Inputs'): \"Table 3 reports the average number of mutations per image (Mutations), the average number of adversarial inputs found per image (Adv. Inputs), the total number of incorrectly classified labels (Labels), and the number of initial inputs (Seeds) from which adversarial inputs were found.\" \n\nPage 173 (Section 4.3): \"In particular, the adversarial images found for VGG-19 and ResNet-50 were visually indistinguishable from the original ones.\" \n\nPage 169 (Section 4.1 / Table 2): \"We used two datasets and four neural network models in Table 2... LeNet-4, LeNet-5, VGG-19 and ResNet-50\" (standard pre-trained models; no defended/safety-aligned models are listed). \n\nPage 174 (Conclusion): \"we demonstrated that Adapt is significantly more effective than existing white-box and grey-box techniques in increasing coverage and finding adversarial inputs.\""
