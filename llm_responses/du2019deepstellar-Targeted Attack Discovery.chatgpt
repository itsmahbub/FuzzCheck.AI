  "why": "DeepStellar's testing component (Coverage-Guided Testing, CGT) is designed to generate inputs that produce incorrect predictions (i.e., discover misclassifications) or increase coverage, rather than to drive the model toward attacker-chosen, specific outputs. The CGT oracle treats a mutant as an adversarial sample when it is \"predicted incorrectly by the network\" and retains mutants that increase coverage; its selection logic checks for incorrect inference, not for reaching a predefined target label or phrase. Although the authors used externally-produced targeted adversarial examples (e.g., targeted audio commands) for evaluation, that targeted generation was performed by existing attack tools for the experiments, not by the DeepStellar fuzzing/generation strategy itself. Therefore the approach performs untargeted exploration (discovering generic faults/misclassifications) rather than steering exploration toward attacker-chosen outputs.",
  "evidence": "Section 5.2 (Coverage-Guided Testing): \"we propose a Coverage-Guided Testing (CGT) technique which aims to generate adversarial samples incorrectly recognized by an RNN.\" (paper, Section 5.2, p. 481). Algorithm 2 (Coverage guided testing of RNN): the algorithm marks a mutant as a failure when it is mispredicted: \"if Failed(a’, result) then F ← F {a’}\" (paper, Section 5.2, Algorithm 2, p. 481). Section 6.1 (Experiment Settings) describes targeted adversarial examples used for evaluation but indicates they were generated separately: \"To be specific, we select the 11 commands [13] as the targets and generate 1,100 (100 seeds × 11 targets) adversarial audios, which took about 12 days in total on 4 GPUs\" (paper, Section 6.1, p. 483). These quotes show (1) CGT seeks incorrect predictions/coverage increases (untargeted), and (2) targeted examples in the study were produced by external attack generation for evaluation rather than by DeepStellar steering tests toward attacker-chosen outputs."
