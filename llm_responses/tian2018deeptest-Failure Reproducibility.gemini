  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method, DeepTest, generates new test inputs by applying semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations to seed images. These transformations include brightness/contrast adjustment, rotation, scaling, blurring, and adding synthetic fog or rain effects. According to the metric definition, using such metamorphic transformations without explicitly handling serialization effects (like quantization, rounding, or clipping) provides only partial enforcement of failure reproducibility. The paper describes applying these transformations using libraries like OpenCV and Photoshop filters but does not mention any steps to ensure that the resulting numerical perturbations in the image data would persist after standard I/O operations (e.g., saving to a PNG or JPEG file). There is no discussion of how floating-point pixel values are handled or whether they are constrained to a specific bit depth, meaning fault-inducing perturbations could be lost or altered upon serialization. This approach aligns directly with the 'Medium' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2, Increasing Coverage with Synthetic Images: \"Therefore, DeepTest focuses on generating realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations on seed images and mimic different real-world phenomena like camera lens distortions, object movements, different weather conditions, etc. To this end, we investigate nine different realistic image transformations (changing brightness, changing contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, blurring, fog effect, and rain effect). These transformations can be classified into three groups: linear, affine, and convolutional.\""
