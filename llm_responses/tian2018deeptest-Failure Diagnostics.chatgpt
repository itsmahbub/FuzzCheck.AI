  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides substantial diagnostic insight using observable model internals and statistical failure patterns: it uses neuron-coverage as an internal signal, measures correlations between coverage and outputs, compares activated-neuron sets across transformations (Jaccard distances), reports per-transformation and per-model failure statistics, and even shows that retraining on generated failures reduces error. However, it does not offer deeper causal explanations that link specific failures to underlying model vulnerabilities (e.g., precise reliance on spurious/non-robust features, explicit dataset bias analysis, or detailed neuron-/layer-level root-cause attributions). Thus the work surpasses mere reporting (not Low) but stops short of the explanatory, vulnerability-rooted analysis required for a High rating.",
  "evidence": "• Use of neuron-coverage as internal diagnostic signal (Introduction / contribution): \"We empirically demonstrate that changes in neuron coverage correlate with changes in an autonomous car’s behavior.\" (p.303, Introduction / contributions).; • Statistical linkage between coverage and outputs (Section 5 / RQ1): \"Table 5 shows that Spearman correlations for all the models are statistically significant... This result indicates that the neuron coverage changes with the changes in output steering angles\" (p.308, Section 5, RQ1 and Table 5).; • Analysis of which neurons transform-variants activate (Section 5 / RQ2): \"These results indicate that for all models, except Chauffeur-LSTM, different transformations activate different neurons.\" (p.309, Section 5, RQ2; Figure 4 shows Jaccard distances).; • Statistical failure-pattern reporting across transformations and models: Table 7 and Table 8 enumerate numbers of erroneous behaviors by transformation, thresholds, and model, and the paper notes: \"Interestingly, some models are more prone to erroneous behaviors for some transformations than others.\" (p.311, Section 5, discussion around Tables 7–8).; • Metamorphic-oracle formulation used to detect failures (Section 3.4): \"We redefine a new metamorphic relation as: (ˆθi − θti)^2 ≤ λ MSEorig\" (p.307, Section 3.4).; • Empirical link to training-data coverage (retraining experiment): \"In all cases, the accuracy of the retrained model improved significantly over the original model as shown in Table 9.\" (p.311, Section 5, RQ5 and Table 9) — this provides an empirical connection suggesting some failures relate to missing data conditions. ; • Manual inspection of false positives: \"We also manually checked the bugs reported in Table 8 and report the false positives in Figure 8.\" (p.311, Section 5)."
