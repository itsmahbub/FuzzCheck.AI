  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The PAIR method explicitly constrains prompt generation via rule-based attacker system prompts (role-playing, logical appeal, authority endorsement), JSON output formats, and in-context examples that keep mutations semantic and human-interpretable in each iteration. These design choices enforce plausibility at the individual mutation step level. However, the paper does not provide an explicit mechanism or empirical evaluation that enforces or measures plausibility across cumulative iterations (e.g., no bounded-perturbation guarantees or perceptual/semantic metrics like perplexity reported for final fault-inducing prompts), nor a human study that directly assesses the realism of final jailbreak prompts. Therefore PAIR enforces plausibility through rule-based / template constraints per mutation but does not validate or measure cumulative drift of final inputs, matching the Medium category.",
  "evidence": "III-A Attacker’s system prompt (p.25): \"we carefully design three distinct system prompts templates, all of which instructs the LLM to output a specific kind of objectionable content... each system prompt template is based on one of three criteria: logical appeal, authority endorsement, and role-playing.\"; III-A (p.25): \"Format... we require that the attacker generate its responses in JSON format.\" (shows rule-based/template constraints and structured generation per iteration). Algorithm / Iterative refinement (III-B, p.25): \"If S == 1 then return P ... otherwise the conversation is updated... the conversation history is then passed back to the attacker, and the process repeats.\" (shows iterative mutation without bounded perturbation guarantees). IV Evaluation (p.26): \"We compute the Jailbreak %—the percentage of behaviors that elicit a jailbroken response according to JUDGE—and the Queries per Success.\" (evaluation reports jailbreak rates, not perceptual/plausibility metrics). IV / JUDGE dataset (p.26, Table I): \"We collected a dataset of 100 prompts and responses... Three expert annotators labeled each pair...\" (human annotation was used to evaluate JUDGE agreement on jailbreak labeling, not to assess plausibility of generated prompts). Appendix C / Examples (pp.41-42): contains example generated prompts and conversations (illustrative human-interpretable examples), but no reported human study or quantitative plausibility measures such as perplexity, LPIPS, SSIM, PESQ, STOI, or Perplexity for final fault-inducing prompts."
