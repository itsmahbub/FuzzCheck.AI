  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility by performing all mutations/search inside a learned style space produced by a MUNIT image-to-image translation model: style vectors sampled or evolved from that space are decoded by the generator to produce test images, so mutated inputs remain drawn from a distribution of real environmental conditions captured by data. The authors also provide empirical human-evaluation evidence that the final synthesized, fault-inducing driving scenes are perceptually realistic (a user study with 34 participants showing TACTIC images are judged realistic and correctly classified to their environmental types). Together, these show (1) plausibility is enforced throughout the fuzzing/search process by constraining search to the MUNIT style space and (2) final fault-inducing inputs were validated as realistic via a user study.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Introduction: \"Because of the richness of styles, the synthesised scenes are realistic enough (as shown by Figure 1(d)) to test whether the DNN-based ADS can perform correctly under the environmental conditions corresponding to the obtained styles.\" \n\nPage 3, Section 3.1 (Environmental Conditions): \"To encode the environmental condition space of an environmental type, we leverage MUNIT ... One insight of MUNIT is that the representation of images can be decomposed into a content space that is domain-invariant and a style space that captures domain-specific characteristics ... we can use the style space of an environmental type in a well-trained MUNIT model to represent the environmental condition space of the type.\" \n\nPage 4, Section 3.3 (Search of Critical Environmental Conditions): \"The (1+1) ES is initialised with an initial individual, which is a style vector randomly sampled from the style space in the MUNIT model. ... a new individual s' is firstly generated based on the current individual s. Then, the fitness values of s and s' is evaluated ... the individual with higher fitness value is kept.\" \n\nPage 6, Section 4.3 (Comparison with Baselines on Image Quality / User Study): \"we conduct a user study to evaluate the realism of the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC ... We received answers from a total of 34 participants ... The results demonstrate that the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC are more realistic than the ones synthesised by affine image transformation (e.g., DeepTest) or high-fidelity simulation (e.g., PreScan) and can better reflect real environments.\""
