  "why": "The paper does not demonstrate or measure whether fault-inducing inputs crafted on one model transfer to other models performing the same task. All experiments generate and evaluate adversarial / uncommon inputs per target model (attacks and KuK generation are applied to each model separately) and the evaluation of \"transfer\" in the paper is limited to applying inputs crafted on an original model to a defended/retrained version of that same model (a defense transfer scenario), not to distinct other model implementations or architectures. There is no reported experiment that reuses inputs generated on one surrogate model to test other (unseen) models or that explicitly measures cross-model transferability across different model implementations (e.g., LeNet-5 → NIN or ResNet → MobileNet).",
  "evidence": "Page 740, Introduction (research questions): \"RQ4: To what extent are the uncommon samples defended by existing adversarial defense techniques compared with the common ones?\" — shows focus on defenses, not cross-model transfer.\n\nPage 743, Section 3.1.3 Data Preparation: \"For each dataset, we prepared the following three sets of data: one set of benign examples, one set of AEs generated from the attack methods, and one set of AEs generated by testing tools... For each input in BenignData, we generated four types of AEs with the four attack methods, resulting in a total of 36,000 AEs.\" — indicates attacks/AEs are generated per model/dataset but does not describe applying them to different model implementations.\n\nPage 748, Section 5.2 Results: \"The reason is that a new model is retrained with these defense techniques, while the attacks are generated regarding to the original one, making it a more challenging transfer attack scenario.\" — the only 'transfer' discussion refers to transfer to a retrained/defended version of the same model, not to other distinct models or architectures.\n\n(Throughout the Methods and Evaluation sections (e.g., Tables 2, 4, 5 and 6) adversarial/uncommon inputs are reported per model; no experiment or section describes testing inputs crafted on one model against other model implementations to measure cross-model transferability.)"
