  "why": "The paper's method, CUREFUZZ, is designed to discover 'crash-triggering scenarios'. A 'crash' is defined as a broad class of catastrophic, security-violating behavior, such as a vehicle collision or a robot falling, rather than a specific, predefined model output. The fuzzing process is explicitly steered towards discovering any scenario that leads to these general unsafe behaviors by prioritizing seeds based on their novelty and probability of triggering a crash. This aligns with the 'Medium' definition, as it supports the discovery of broader classes of unsafe behaviors without targeting a specific, attacker-chosen output.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2, Approach Overview: \"CUREFUZZ is designed to uncover crash-triggering scenarios that eventually lead to the crash of SDMs. It is crucial to note that the definition of a 'crash' can vary across different environments. For instance, within the context of autonomous driving, a crash could be defined as an incident where an autonomous vehicle collides with pedestrians. In the context of robotics control, a crash can refer to the falling of a walking robot. We employ the term 'crash' to represent its broader conceptual meaning. Furthermore, our methodology focuses on catastrophic failure rather than minor deviations from optimal performance.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.2, Experiment Subject and Environment: The paper defines the target failures for each experiment as a class of unsafe behavior: \"In CARLA, CUREFUZZ checks for the situations when the SDM-controlled vehicle experiences a collision with other vehicles or buildings.\" (4.2.1); \"In ACAS Xu, CUREFUZZ simply aims to find the scenarios when there are collisions between the SDM-controlled airplane with other airplanes.\" (4.2.2); \"We aim to find the scenarios when the robot falls.\" (4.2.3)."
