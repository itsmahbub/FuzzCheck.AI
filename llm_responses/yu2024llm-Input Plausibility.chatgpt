  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs mutation operators that use LLMs to preserve the semantic correctness of each mutated prompt (i.e., enforcing plausibility between successive mutation steps). However, it does not present an explicit mechanism that enforces or verifies that inputs remain within a plausible input distribution over many chained iterations; the only mechanism addressing accumulation is a reward discount that penalizes deep mutation paths (which indirectly discourages long mutation chains). Thus the work enforces per-step plausibility but overlooks cumulative drift across many fuzzing iterations, matching the metric's \"Medium\" definition.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.3 Mutation (p.4662): \"To maintain the semantic correctness of newly generated prompts, we have introduced five innovative mutation operators that harness LLMs as assistants for prompt alteration while preserving their semantic integrity.\" \n\nSection 3.3 Mutation (p.4662): description of the five operators (Generate, Crossover, Expand, Shorten, Rephrase) shows mutation is LLM-assisted and aimed at producing semantically meaningful variants. \n\nSection 4.1 Experiment Setup (p.4663): \"To foster diversity in the mutations, we set the temperature parameter to 1.0.\" (indicating stochastic LLM sampling for per-step mutations). \n\nSection 3.2 Seed Selection / Algorithm 1 (p.4660-4661): \"we introduce a reward discount factor denoted as α. This factor is multiplied by the depth of the selected path (line 25-26). This design encourages MCTS to balance its selection between deep and shallow nodes...\" and in Algorithm 1: \"reward ← max(reward − α * len(path), β)\" (an indirect mechanism to discourage very deep mutation chains). \n\nSection 3.4 Oracle (p.4662-4663): \"The oracle's role is to take prompts as input and evaluate the responses to determine if they are harmful.\" (oracle assesses outputs for harm, not explicit input plausibility across iterations)."
