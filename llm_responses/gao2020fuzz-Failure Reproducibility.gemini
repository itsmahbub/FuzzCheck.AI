  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper proposes a method, SENSEI, that uses fuzzing with semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations to generate augmented training data. The transformations include geometric operations (rotation, translation, shear, zoom) and color operations (brightness, contrast). According to the metric definition, applying such transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization warrants a 'Medium' rating. The paper details the transformations and their parameter ranges but does not mention any mechanism to account for I/O effects like quantization, rounding, or clipping that occur when saving an image to a file. For instance, a brightness adjustment could create pixel values outside the standard [0, 255] range for 8-bit images, which would be clipped upon serialization. The paper does not state that these effects are considered during the mutation or oracle evaluation (loss calculation) stages. Therefore, while the coarse-grained nature of the transformations provides some resilience against I/O effects compared to fine-grained numerical noise, the lack of explicit handling of serialization means failure reproducibility is only partially enforced.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.2 Generation of Realistic Variations, \"SENSEI focuses on improving the robustness of DNN models by augmenting training data with natural environmental variations. Since, we focus on the applications with image, we choose two major kinds of image operations: i) geometric operations ii) color operations to simulate the camera movements and lighting conditions in real life... The operations and corresponding restrictions with respect to an image x are as follows:\n• rotation(x,d): rotate x by d degree within a range [-30, 30].\n• translation(x, d): horizontally or vertically translate x by d pixels within a range of [-10%, 10%] of image size.\n• shear(x,d): horizontally shear x with a shear factor d within a range of [-0.1, 0.1].\n• zoom(x,d): zoom in/out x with a zoom factor d ranging [0.9,1.1]\n• brightness(x,d): uniformly add or subtract a value d for each pixel of x within a range of [-32, 32]\n• contrast(x,d): scale the RGB value of each pixel of x by a factor d within range of [0.8, 1.2]\""
