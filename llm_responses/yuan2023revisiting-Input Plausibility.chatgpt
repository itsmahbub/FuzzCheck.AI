  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility at each mutation step by (1) restricting mutation operators to realistic transformations (pixel-level, affine, texture-level) and (2) applying an is_valid() per-step check (bounds on changed pixels / max pixel change) before accepting a mutated input as a new seed. These mechanisms ensure plausibility between successive mutation steps. However, the paper does not describe any mechanism that prevents cumulative drift across many successive accepted mutations (e.g., checks against the original-seed distribution, density-based filtering, or explicit distributional plausibility constraints). Thus, plausibility is enforced per-step but cumulative effects across iterations are not explicitly constrained, matching the “Medium” level of the metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 1209, Section VI-B (Guiding Input Mutation in DNN Testing): \"is_valid() is adopted from [47], which deems a mutation as valid if 1) the #changed-pixels is less than α × #pixels or 2) the maximum of changed pixel value is less than β × 255. We set α to 0.2 and β to 0.4.\" (Algorithm 1 shows that a mutated input is added to the seed pool only if is_valid(sˆ,s) and coverage increases: \"if is_valid(sˆ,s) and coverage_inc(C,D) then S.add(sˆ); update_coverage(C); break;\"). Page 1209, Table IX (Transformations): lists realistic mutation operators used: \"Pixel-Level: contrast, brightness; Affine: translation, scaling, rotation; Texture-Level: blurring, stylizing.\" Page 1210, Section VI-B (Naturalness of Mutations): empirical evidence that NLC-guided mutations remain more natural: \"Overall, mutated images guided by NLC have the best scores for both IS and FID.\" The paper contains no description of any global or cumulative plausibility enforcement (e.g., distributional checks or rollback based on distance to original seed), only the per-step is_valid acceptance policy and selection of realistic operators."
