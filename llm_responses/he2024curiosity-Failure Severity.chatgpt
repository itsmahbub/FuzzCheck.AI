  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper shows CureFuzz uncovers safety-critical, undesired behaviors (crash-triggering scenarios such as vehicle/aircraft collisions and robot falls) that violate user safety expectations, but it does not present any results or claims that it bypasses explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms (e.g., adversarially-trained or safety-aligned models), nor does it report security-critical violations like data leakage, jailbreaks, or unauthorized actions. Therefore the failures discovered are high-impact safety violations in the sense of causing crashes, but they are not described as bypassing explicit defenses or security mechanisms, which matches the \"Medium\" category.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section 3.1 Assumption: \"CureFuzz is designed to uncover crash-triggering scenarios that eventually lead to the crash of SDMs.\"; Page 6, Section 4.2.1 Autonomous Driving: \"In the CARLA simulator ... CureFuzz checks for the situations when the SDM-controlled vehicle experiences a collision with other vehicles or buildings.\"; Page 6, Section 4.2.2 Aircraft Collision Avoidance: \"In ACAS Xu, CureFuzz simply aims to find the scenarios when there are collisions between the SDM-controlled airplane with other airplanes.\"; Page 6-7, Section 4.2.3 Video Game / BipedalWalker: \"We aim to find the scenarios when the robot falls.\"; Page 10, RQ3 Results: \"For the repaired ACAS Xu, 55 faults and 4 distinct types of crash-triggering scenarios are detected. We find that the crashes found by CureFuzz are reduced by 73% compared with the original DNN model.\" (shows focus on crash detection and repair rather than bypassing defenses)."
