  "value": "Low",
  "why": "While the paper uses GPT-4 to produce coherent paraphrases and adversarial suffixes, it does not include any mechanism—such as bounding semantic drift, enforcing similarity constraints, or filtering implausible candidates—to ensure that mutated prompts remain realistic or semantically valid over multiple iterations. Apart from a one-time manual check of the synonymous-query dataset, the iterative coverage-guided jailbreak case generation (seed → GPT-4 rewrite → coverage-based selection) has no stated plausibility enforcement. As a result, the approach allows cumulative drift away from a plausible input distribution, falling into the 'Low' category.",
  "evidence": "Section III-A (Test Suite Construction) describes manual verification only for the initial synonymous-paraphrase dataset. Section V-C (\"Jailbreak Case Generation\") outlines iterative GPT-4 rewriting and coverage-based selection over five rounds without any plausibility or semantic-similarity constraints."
