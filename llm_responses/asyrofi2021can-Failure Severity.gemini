  "why": "The paper's methodology focuses exclusively on uncovering and correcting model robustness errors, specifically mispredictions in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. A failure is strictly defined as an instance where the ASR system's output transcription does not match the ground-truth input text. The evaluation metrics used are the 'number of failed test cases' and 'Word Error Rate (WER)', both of which measure transcription accuracy. The paper does not investigate or report on failures related to unsafe behavior (e.g., toxic or biased outputs) nor does it attempt to bypass any explicit safety or security mechanisms. The uncovered failures are purely prediction inconsistencies.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section II-A, 'CrossASR++': 'A valid test case can be either a failed test case or a successful test case. If the SUT transcription is different from the input text, it means that CrossASR++ uncovers a failed test case for the SUT. Otherwise, a successful test case is found.'"
