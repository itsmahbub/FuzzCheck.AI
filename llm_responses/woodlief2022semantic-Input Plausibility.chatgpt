  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility at the level of individual semantic mutations: it scopes allowed mutations to entities present in the dataset, uses per-mutation preconditions, parameterizes image edits using real extracted entities (resource set), and performs conformity checks (perspective, lighting, road placement) before accepting a mutated test. These measures constrain each mutation to be plausible. However, the paper does not enforce or evaluate plausibility across multiple chained/iterative mutation steps (cumulative drift), and several admitted limitations remain (missing shadows, perspective mismatches, overlap issues). The authors also attempted a learned discriminator but report it could not reliably distinguish conforming vs nonconforming images and the evaluation found a substantial false-positive rate. Together, this shows strong per-mutation plausibility controls but an absence of mechanisms that guarantee plausibility is preserved over iterative mutation sequences, so the appropriate rating is Medium.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 (page 1960): \"First, we scope the space of all mutations Δ based on the entities that appear in the interps of the available tests... Second, we associate a set of preconditions Prec with each mutation δ, specified in terms of the interp that defines whether δ is applicable to a given t... Third, we enable the parameterization of δ_r to employ real sensor data to increase the likelihood of conformity.\" \n\nSection 4.1 (page 1961): \"Given a mutation δ, semImFuzz selects a test case t and queries the resource set for viable resources to perform δ. It then selects a resource and checks whether mutating using t, δ, and the selected resource will generate a conforming test. If so, it applies the mutation to generate t', otherwise it selects another resource and repeats.\" \n\nSection 4.4.4 (page 1963): \"We explored this approach, training a binary classifier based on a CNN using over 48,000 images... The discriminator learned to differentiate between the classes, but could not differentiate conforming versus nonconforming images.\" \n\nSection 4 (page 1960) and 4.3 text (pages 1962–1963) document remaining conformity gaps: e.g., \"semImFuzz does not attempt to add a shadow when adding an entity. This can lead to nonconforming images, as shown in Figure 9d.\" \n\nSection 6.2 (page 1965): \"we ran each SUT on 150,000 tests generated by semImFuzz comprised of 50,000 'Add Car' mutations, 50,000 'Add Person' mutations, and 50,000 'Change Car Color' mutations.\" (shows tests are generated from single semantic edits rather than iterative chaining).\n\nSection 6.4 / Table 2 (page 1967): \"The high false positive rate reflects the challenging application domain to achieve conformity.\" (reports substantial false-positive rates after manual inspection)."
