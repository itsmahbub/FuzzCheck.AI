  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper reports discovered failures and quantifies improvements (number of failed test cases and WER) after fine-tuning, but it does not perform diagnostic analysis of model internals (e.g., neuron activations, coverage, layer characteristics) nor statistical analyses of failure patterns that link failures to underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on non-robust/spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting. In fact, the approach is explicitly described as black-box differential testing and its evaluations focus on counts and WER improvements rather than explanations of why failures occur.",
  "evidence": "Page 675, Section II.A (description of approach): \"Both tools leverage recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems and ASR systems to uncover failed test cases in a purely black-box manner.\" \n\nPage 676, Section III.C (metrics used for evaluation): \"We use two metrics to evaluate the performance of the SUT. One is the number of failed test cases uncovered by CrossASR++, and the other is the word error rate (WER) on a test set.\" \n\nPage 677, Section III.C (reporting results without diagnostics): \"The number of failed test cases found decreases from 399 to 296, which is a 25.81% reduction... the WER of the evolved SUT is 4.33%, which surpasses the WER of the static SUT (7.99%). The evolution corresponds to a 45.81% relative improvement of the WER.\" \n\nPage 678, Conclusion (summary focus on improvement outcomes): \"we empirically show that by fine-tuning the target ASR using generated test cases, the number of failed test cases uncovered decreases by 25.81%, and the WER decreases by 45.81%.\""
