  "why": "The paper presents a black-box differential testing approach, which by its nature does not analyze model internals like neuron coverage or activations. The primary analysis of failures is presented in Section IV.B, which focuses exclusively on categorizing *false positives* found during manual verification. This analysis diagnoses issues with the testing infrastructure—such as problems with the Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine, limitations of the text preprocessing step, or ambiguous audio generation—rather than providing diagnostic insight into the actual failures of the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models under test. The paper successfully reports numerous failure cases with examples (Section IV.A) and provides aggregate failure counts to compare the relative reliability of different ASR systems, but it does not perform statistical analysis of true failure patterns or connect the failures to underlying model vulnerabilities like dataset bias or reliance on non-robust features. Therefore, it reports failures without providing the diagnostic insight required for a higher rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section IV.B, \"Analysis of False Positive Failed Test Case from Manual Verification\": \"From 33,618 failed test cases, we manually verified a statistically representative sample of size 395 and found 12 of them to be false positives. We analyze these false positives and observed that they can be categorized into 4 different cases: (1) Human deems the audio to be the same as the transcribed text, but different from the original text. This highlights a problem with the TTS. ... (2) Human deems the audio to be different from both transcribed and input text. This indicates a problem with the TTS. ... (3) Cases highlighting limitations of our Text Preprocessing step. ... (4) Audio is ambiguous; It can match both texts.\""
