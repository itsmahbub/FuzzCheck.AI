  "why": "The paper's proposed method for generating adversarial samples, called Coverage-Guided Testing (CGT), performs untargeted exploration to discover generic failures. The explicit goal is to find inputs that are \"incorrectly recognized by an RNN,\" without specifying a particular target output. The testing oracle, which determines if a generated sample is a failure, is based on metamorphic testing. This means it identifies failures when meaning-preserving mutations cause the model's prediction to change, which is a form of generic inconsistency or misclassification. The exploration process, as detailed in Algorithm 2, is guided by increasing state and transition coverage metrics, not by steering towards a predefined, attacker-chosen outcome. While the paper mentions using external tools to generate targeted adversarial samples, this is done solely to create a dataset for evaluating their separate adversarial sample *detection* algorithm, not as a feature of their own test *generation* method.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5.2, 'Coverage-Guided Testing of RNNs': The paper describes its generation technique's goal as untargeted: 'we propose a Coverage-Guided Testing (CGT) technique which aims to generate adversarial samples incorrectly recognized by an RNN.' The failure condition is defined as a generic error: 'A mutant is an adversarial sample if it is predicted incorrectly by the network.' The method for identifying these failures relies on a metamorphic oracle rather than a specific target: 'For CGT, we mainly focus on image classification and apply the metamorphic mutation strategy [55] for generating new mutants that would keep the prediction meaning from the human’s perspective during testing.'"
