  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper introduces DeepTest, a tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors in DNNs for autonomous cars. The failures it uncovers are significant deviations in steering angle under realistic, synthetically generated environmental conditions like rain, fog, and different lighting. These incorrect steering predictions can lead to \"potentially fatal crashes,\" which are clear violations of safety expectations and constitute unsafe behavior. The evaluation demonstrates finding thousands of such dangerous behaviors. The models under test are standard DNNs from a driving challenge and are not described as having explicit safety or security mechanisms that DeepTest bypasses. Therefore, the failures align with the 'Medium' severity level, as the tool uncovers unsafe behavior without the context of bypassing explicit defenses.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Abstract: \"In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate DeepTest, a systematic testing tool for automatically detecting erroneous behaviors of DNN-driven vehicles that can potentially lead to fatal crashes. ... DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.\"\n\nPage 3, Figure 1 Caption: \"A sample dangerous erroneous behavior found by DeepTest in the Chauffeur DNN.\" (The accompanying image shows the car steering off the road in a synthetically generated rainy condition)."
