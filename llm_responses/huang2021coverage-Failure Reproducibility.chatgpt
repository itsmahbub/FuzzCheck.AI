  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper partially considers serialization/I/O effects but does not fully or explicitly enforce reproducibility under standard serialization (e.g., quantization/encoding). The authors take steps that help make mutations persistently valid for discrete/serialized inputs (text via EDA mutants; SMILES enumeration) and they apply rounding/clipping for image pixel ranges, which mitigate some I/O loss. However, they do not describe explicit handling of standard I/O serialization effects such as 8-bit quantization, encoder rounding/clipping from common formats (PNG/JPEG/WAV/MP3), nor do they state that they generate inputs directly in serialized file formats or verify that failures persist after typical save/load operations. These facts match the definition of Medium: partial consideration (clipping/semantic-preserving metamorphoses) but no explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization.",
  "evidence": "VI.B.1 Random Mutation (page 1197): \"When the LSTM input has continuous values (e.g., image input), Gaussian noises with fixed mean and variance are added to the input.\"  VII.A.3 Input Mutation (page 1199): \"For MNIST model, we add Gaussian noise to input image and round off the decimals around 0 and 1 to make the pixel value stay within the value range.\"  VII.A.3 Input Mutation (page 1199): \"The input to IMDB model is a sequence of words... To avoid this, we take a set M of mutants from the EDA toolkit... This ensures the mutated text paragraphs are always valid.\"  VII.A.4 Oracle Setting (page 1199): \"For continuous inputs, such as images and videos, we calculate the Euclidean distance as the measurement of perturbation.\"  (No section or quote in the paper describes explicit handling or verification of standard I/O serialization effects such as 8-bit quantization or file-format encoding/decoding to ensure failures persist after save/load.)"
