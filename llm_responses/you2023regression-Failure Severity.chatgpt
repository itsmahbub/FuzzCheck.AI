  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper explicitly defines regression faults as cases where the new model version makes wrong predictions while the prior version was correct, and the proposed DRFuzz is designed to discover such mispredictions (diversity/fidelity of inputs). The evaluation and examples focus on classification errors, bias/overfitting explanations, and counts of regression mispredictions across image datasets and regression scenarios (including adversarially-trained models). The work does not claim or demonstrate uncovering high-impact safety/security violations (e.g., jailbreaks, data leakage, unauthorized actions, toxic or hallucinated outputs) nor bypassing explicit safety/policy mechanisms. Therefore DRFuzz uncovers model robustness/regression errors only, which corresponds to the Low severity level in the metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 82, Introduction: \"Detecting regression faults refers to finding test inputs that make the current version produce wrong predictions but make the prior version produce correct predictions.\"; Page 84, Section II. DEFINITION, \"Definition 2. Regression fault. ... x is called to trigger a regression fault if x is correctly predicted by M1, yet wrongly predicted by M2, i.e., cM1[x] = y ∧ cM2[x] ≠ y.\"; Page 87, Section IV-A2 (Regression Scenarios): \"Adversarial Training ... fine-tunes the model by incorporating adversarial inputs and then produces a new version of the model.\" (evaluations report numbers of regression mispredictions in these scenarios but do not report safety/security violations such as data leakage or unauthorized actions)."
