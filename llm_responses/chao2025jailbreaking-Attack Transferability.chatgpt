  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly evaluates transferability by reusing jailbreak prompts found on one model to test other models (Section IV-B, Table VI) and reports transfer percentages. Furthermore, the PAIR design intentionally generates semantic, prompt-level (interpretable) attacks—via attacker system-prompt templates, chain-of-thought improvement assessments, and parallel streams—which the authors argue and evidence as supporting cross-model transferability (they compare PAIR vs GCG transfer and attribute better transfer to PAIR's semantic prompts). Thus the paper both demonstrates reuse of fault-inducing inputs across models and incorporates design choices aimed at discovering transferable failures.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p. 23): \"PAIR also achieves competitive jailbreaking success rates and transferability on open and closed‑source LLMs, including GPT-3.5/4, Vicuna, and Gemini.\"; Introduction / Contributions (p. 23): \"We also find that PAIR jailbreaks are often more trans‑ferrable to other LLMs than jailbreaks generated by GCG.\"; Section IV-B 'Jailbreak transfer experiments' (p. 28): \"For PAIR, we use the successful jailbreaks found for GPT-4 and Vicuna... Our results in Table VI indicate that PAIR’s Vicuna prompts transfer more readily than those generated by GCG on all models except GPT-3.5, and PAIR’s GPT-4 prompts transfer well on Vicuna, GPT-3.5, and Gemini. We believe that this is largely attributable to the fact that PAIR’s prompts are semantic, and they therefore target similar vulnerabilities across LLMs...\"; Table VI caption (p. 28): \"Jailbreak transferability. We report the jailbreaking percentage of prompts that successfully jailbreak a source LLM when transferred to downstream LLM.\""
