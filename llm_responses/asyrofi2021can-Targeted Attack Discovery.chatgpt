  "why": "The paper's CrossASR++ design performs untargeted differential testing: it synthesizes audio from corpus texts and seeks any mismatch between the SUT's transcription and the input text (i.e., generic misrecognitions). Its mutation (TTS of corpus texts), exploration (a failure estimator that ranks texts by likelihood of producing a failure), and oracle (cross-referencing that marks a test as failed if the SUT transcription differs from the input text) all aim to discover generic failures rather than to steer the fuzzer toward attacker-chosen, specific target outputs or phrases. There is no mechanism described to drive exploration toward inducing a predefined label, phrase, command, or other attacker-specified output—only to find cases where the SUT differs from the reference—so the work aligns with untargeted exploration under the metric definition.",
  "evidence": "Page 675, Section II.A (CrossASR++): \"The generated audio file is then fed to all ASR systems inside CrossASR++ (SUT and ASR1 to ASRm in Fig. 1). The tool cross-references the outputs of these ASR systems and tags the synthesized audio-text pair as a valid test case if at least one of the ASR systems can successfully transcribe the audio (i.e., each word in the transcription matches each corresponding word in the input text). A valid test case can be either a failed test case or a successful test case. If the SUT transcription is different from the input text, it means that CrossASR++ uncovers a failed test case for the SUT.\"; Page 675–676, Section II.A (failure estimator): \"The failure estimator is a fine-tuned BERT-based classifier with a softmax layer that outputs the probability of an input text being failed, successful and indeterminable test cases. ... CrossASR++ ranks texts according to their probability in descending order and gives higher priority to the texts with a higher rank.\"; Abstract / Introduction (page 674–675): \"CrossASR++ ... employs a Text-To-Speech (TTS) system to synthesize audios from texts and then reveals failed test cases by feeding them to multiple ASR systems for cross-referencing.\""
