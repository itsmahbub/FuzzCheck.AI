  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by analyzing the relationship between discovered failures (adversarial samples) and observable model internals. It proposes an abstract state transition model for RNNs and defines several coverage criteria based on it. The evaluation explicitly analyzes the sensitivity of these coverage criteria to adversarial samples, demonstrating a correlation between increased coverage and the presence of erroneous behaviors. The paper also identifies a statistical failure pattern, noting that adversarial samples tend to cover rarely visited states and transitions within the abstract model. This constitutes an analysis of model internals and statistical failure patterns. However, the analysis does not extend to explaining the underlying root causes of model vulnerability, such as dataset bias or overfitting, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 6.3 RQ2. Coverage Criteria, Results: \"Table 4 reports the coverage results using different coverage criteria on different dataset... The coverage increase ratio indicates the sensitivity of the coverage criteria to adversarial samples. We observed that finer-grained abstract models tend to have larger coverage increase ratio... In contrast, the increase ratio of WSCov'/WTCov' is larger, with a competitive performance as BSCov and BTCov, indicating rarely visited states and transitions tend to be covered by adversarial/perturbed samples.\""
