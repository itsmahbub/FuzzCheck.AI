  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process using two main strategies. First, for discrete input domains like natural language (IMDB dataset) and molecular representations (Lipophilicity dataset), it employs domain-specific, rule-based mutation operators that are explicitly designed to preserve semantic validity. It uses the EDA toolkit for text, which performs operations like synonym replacement, and the RDkit package for SMILES strings to generate different representations of the same molecule. This ensures that mutated inputs remain within a plausible distribution by design. Second, and more critically, the paper's test oracle introduces a global constraint that prevents cumulative drift from the original seed input. Algorithm 1 checks if a mutated input `x'` is still within a norm-ball of a specified radius (`roracle`) around its *original seed* (`orig(x)`). This directly addresses the issue of perturbations accumulating across iterations, ensuring that any discovered failure-inducing input remains plausibly close to a realistic data point. The paper also explicitly contrasts its 'natural' test cases with the less comprehensible outputs from gradient-based attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section VII-A, \"Input Mutation\": \"To avoid this, we take a set M of mutants from the EDA toolkit [48], which was originally designed to augment the training data for improvement on text classification tasks. This ensures the mutated text paragraphs are always valid... For Lipophilicity model, we take a set M of mutants that change the SMILES string without affecting the molecular structure it represents.\"\n\nPage 7, Algorithm 1: TESTRNN Algorithm, line 9: \"if ||orig(x) - x'||2 ≤ roracle and φ(x) ≠ φ(x') then | Tadv ← Tadv ∪ {x'}\" (The text clarifies that `orig(x)` maps each test case back to its seed origin, thus `roracle` constrains the cumulative perturbation from the seed).\n\nPage 12, Section VII-E, \"Comparison With Attack-Based Defect Detection (RQ6)\": \"On the other hand, our testing method is able to reduce such problems by taking the mutants from off-the-shelf tools, such as the EDA toolkit. Fig. 6 presents adversarial movie reviews returned by attack method and TESTRNN, respectively. It is easy to see that the adversarial review returned by the gradient attack is hard to comprehend, whereas the one from TESTRNN is much easier.\""
