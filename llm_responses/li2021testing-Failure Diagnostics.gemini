  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by analyzing the correlation between observable model internals (DNN coverage) and the number of discovered failures. The core methodology uses DNN coverage metrics (KMNC and NBC) as part of its fitness function to guide the search for critical environmental conditions that cause erroneous behaviors. The experimental evaluation consistently presents the achieved coverage alongside the number of detected errors, demonstrating that their approach, which increases coverage, also reveals more diverse and numerous failures. This constitutes an analysis of model internals and their connection to failures. However, the paper does not extend this analysis to explain the root causes of these failures in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.2.3. FITNESS FUNCTION DEFINITION: 'The ability to detect diverse erroneous behaviours of a style vector is measured by the increase in the testing coverage measured by KMNC or NBC. Let Rt be the set of uncovered KMNC/NBC regions so far during the searchbased testing process and Rs be the set of regions that will be newly covered by the synthesised driving scenes using style vector s. The ability of s to detect diverse erroneous behaviours is calculated as: Fc(s) = |Rs|/|Rt|'. \n\nPage 7, Section 4.2. Comparison with Baselines on Effectiveness, Results: 'In terms of the achieved coverage, compared with Rc, TACTIC achieves higher coverage in all environmental types, demonstrating that TACTIC can detect more diverse erroneous behaviours than Rc. ... In terms of the detected erroneous behaviours, compared with Rc and DeepRoad, TACTIC detects many more erroneous behaviours in all environmental types for both four error bounds.' This is further supported by Tables 1 and 2 which list coverage metrics and the number of errors side-by-side for comparison."
