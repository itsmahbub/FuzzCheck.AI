  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility at the level of individual mutation steps (domain-specific/metamorphic transformations and ‘conservative’ parameters that produce slight, imperceptible perturbations), but it does not present an explicit mechanism to prevent or bound cumulative drift across multiple successive fuzzing iterations (e.g., no global/bounded-perturbation constraint relative to the original seed or a plausibility filter applied after multiple mutations). The coverage-guided testing loop retains mutants that increase coverage and reuses them as seeds, which allows successive mutations to accumulate; plausibility is only argued informally (metamorphic choices, conservative params), not enforced across iterations.",
  "evidence": "Section 5.2 Coverage-Guided Testing (page 480/481): \"Mutation operators are often specific to the application domains. For CGT, we mainly focus on image classification and apply the metamorphic mutation strategy [55] for generating new mutants that would keep the prediction meaning from the human’s perspective during testing.\"; Algorithm 2 (Coverage guided testing) (page 480/481): \"3 while a <- Select(Q) do ... 4 Randomly pick transformation t with a random parameter p; 5 A = mutate(t, p, a); ... 11 else if CoverageIncrease(cov, Q) then 12 Q <- Q ∪ a'; 13 UpdateCoverage(Q);\" (shows mutants that increase coverage are re-added as seeds, enabling iterative accumulation); Section 6.1 Data Preparation (page 482): \"For both audio and image case, we set conservative parameters for transformation so that the perturbation on original samples is slight and imperceptible. Note that all the adversarial samples are also with minimal perturbations and not perceptible by human.\""
