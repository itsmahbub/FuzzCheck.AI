  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's proposed method, TACTIC, is explicitly designed to generate plausible and realistic test inputs. It uses a GAN-based image-to-image translation model (MUNIT) trained on real-world images of various environmental conditions, which inherently constrains the generated outputs to a plausible distribution. The paper goes further and provides direct empirical evidence of this plausibility through a dedicated user study. This study compares the realism of scenes generated by TACTIC against real-world images and other baseline methods. The results show that a significant portion of TACTIC's generated images were considered as realistic as real-world images by human participants. This combination of using a plausibility-aware generation mechanism and empirically validating the realism of the final fault-inducing inputs with a human study directly meets the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.3, 'Comparison with Baselines on Image Quality': 'We conduct a user study to evaluate the realism of the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC... Specifically, we design an online questionnaire consisting of two questions: (1) “Which driving scene is more realistic?”, and (2) “Which environmental type does the driving scene belong to?”.'\nPage 8, Section 4.3, Results: 'The results demonstrate that the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC are more realistic than the ones synthesised by affine image transformation (e.g., DeepTest) or high-fidelity simulation (e.g., PreScan) and can better reflect real environments.'\nPage 9, Figure 5 and accompanying text: The results of the user study are presented, showing that for 44% of image pairs (27% 'both realistic' + 16% 'synthesized scene' + 1% 'both unrealistic' is likely a typo in my reading, the text says 44% for TACTIC and DeepRoad where synthesized are not distinguishable from real ones), TACTIC's synthesized scenes were considered as realistic or more realistic than real-world scenes, a stark contrast to DeepTest (6%) and PreScan (14%)."
