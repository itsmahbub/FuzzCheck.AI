  "why": "The paper's evaluation reuses the generated fault-inducing inputs across multiple models but the fuzzing design is not explicitly aimed at discovering transferable attacks. The methodology involves creating a single set of 150,000 mutated inputs and then executing this same set against five different perception models (SUTs) performing the same task. This experimental design inherently tests for transferability by observing how different models react to the same set of inputs. However, the design of the fuzzer, `semImFuzz`, focuses on generating semantically valid and conforming mutations based on real-world constraints (e.g., adding cars to roads, changing colors) rather than incorporating explicit mechanisms to discover vulnerabilities that are common across different model architectures. Therefore, it satisfies the condition of reusing inputs but lacks the explicit design goal for transferability required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section 6.2 Tests Generated, \"For evaluation, we ran each SUT on 150,000 tests generated by semImFuzz comprised of 50,000 \"Add Car\" mutations, 50,000 \"Add Person\" mutations, and 50,000 “Change Car Color” mutations.\""
