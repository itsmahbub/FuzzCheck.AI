  "why": "The paper's method, PAPILLON, is explicitly designed to maintain the plausibility and semantic coherence of its generated inputs (jailbreak prompts) throughout the fuzzing process. The mutation strategies leverage an LLM helper specifically to generate natural and fluent prompts, directly addressing the limitations of prior work that produced 'gibberish' or 'unintelligible' outputs. The paper provides strong empirical evidence for the plausibility of the final, fault-inducing prompts through two distinct mechanisms: 1) a quantitative assessment using perplexity, a standard measure for linguistic fluency, demonstrating that their prompts have low perplexity scores, and 2) a dedicated human evaluation study that measures the 'interpretability' and 'naturalness' of the generated prompts, finding them to be superior to manually crafted ones.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section 4.2, 'Maintain semantic coherence': 'Ensuring that the generated adversarial prompts are readable (low perplexity) is crucial for evading existing jailbreak defenses based on perplexity filters. In this paper, we propose using GPT-driven mutation operators to create jailbreaking templates, allowing us to preserve the semantic integrity of the generated templates throughout the mutation process. Experiments show that the average perplexity of our generated jailbreak prompts for GPT-3.5 Turbo is as low as 34.61, significantly below the average perplexity threshold of 58.83.'\n\nPage 14, Section 7, 'Human Evaluation': 'Prompts quality. To evaluate the interpretability and naturalness of the generated prompts, we developed two criteria for quantifiable human evaluation. For interpretability, we measure how easily humans can understand the mechanism behind the jailbreak prompt... Naturalness is assessed based on the readability of the prompt... We observed that our generated jailbreak prompts match or surpass manually crafted ones in interpretability and naturalness.' Table 9 on page 15 provides the quantitative results of this human study, showing PAPILLON's prompts achieved higher scores for both interpretability (4.64 vs 3.98) and naturalness (4.60 vs 3.66) compared to a baseline of manually crafted prompts."
