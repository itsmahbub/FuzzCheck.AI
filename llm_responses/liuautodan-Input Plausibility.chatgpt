  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs per-mutation constraints and mechanisms to preserve semantic plausibility (LLM-based diversification for initialization and mutation, synonym-based/momentum word replacement, and a low mutation probability), and it validates final fault-inducing prompts with a task-specific quantitative measure (sentence perplexity / PPL) and defense experiments (perplexity-based defense). However, the paper does not describe an explicit mechanism that enforces or measures plausibility across the entire evolutionary trajectory (i.e., cumulative drift across iterations) nor report iterative/plausibility traces; instead it relies on per-step design choices and final PPL measurements. Thus it validates final-input plausibility and constrains individual mutation steps but does not address cumulative-effects across many iterations, matching the metric's Medium level.",
  "evidence": "3.2 Population Initialization (page 4): \"we employ LLMs as the agents responsible for revising the prototype prompt ... the modifications proposed by LLM can preserve the inherent logical flow and meaning of the original sentences, while simultaneously introducing diversity in word selection and sentence structure.\"; 3.4 Paragraph-level (page 5): \"We let the LLM-based diversification introduced in Alg. 5 to also serve as the mutation function due to its ability to preserve the global meaning and introduce diversity.\"; D.2 Implementation details (Appendix D, page 16): \"...a mutation rate of 0.01... We employ GPT-4-0613 as the base model for the Recheck metric and also as the base model for LLM-based Diversification.\"; 4.1 Metrics (page 6): \"For stealthiness, we use standard Sentence Perplexity (PPL) evaluated by GPT-2 as the metric.\"; 4.2 Results / Table 1 (page 6–7): \"Compared with the baseline, our method exhibits superior performance in terms of PPL, indicating more semantically meaningful and stealthy attacks being generated.\"; 3.5 Termination Criteria (page 5): \"If the algorithm has exhausted the maximum number of iterations or no keyword in a set list Lrefuse is detected in the LLM’s top K words of its response, AutoDAN will terminate...\""
