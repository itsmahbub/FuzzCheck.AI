  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper introduces MDPFuzz, a testing framework designed to find failures where models solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) enter \"abnormal and dangerous states.\" The methodology explicitly moves beyond finding simple robustness errors like prediction inconsistencies, which would fall under the 'Low' severity category. Instead, it defines its testing oracles based on concrete, unsafe behaviors that violate safety expectations for the given domain. For example, in autonomous driving, a failure is a vehicle collision; for aircraft collision avoidance, it is a collision between planes; for a walking agent, it is falling over. These are clear examples of unsafe behaviors that violate user intent and safety expectations. However, the paper does not describe the tested models as having explicit, separate safety or security mechanisms that are being bypassed (a requirement for 'High' severity). It finds failures in the primary, intended function of state-of-the-art models in safety-critical scenarios, thus fitting the 'Medium' category.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 4, \"Inconsistencies vs. Crashes\": \"Real-world models for solving MDPs can quickly recover from 'inconsistent' predictions. This demands the creation of oracles over concrete and severe abnormal states, such as collisions in airplane control or autonomous driving.\"\n\nPage 9, Section 6, \"Testing Oracles (Crash Definition)\": \"For RL and IL models in CARLA, we examine whether the model-controlled vehicle collides with other vehicles or buildings. For DNN-based ACAS Xu, we check collisions of the DNN-controlled airplane with other airplanes. For Coop Navi, we check collisions between MARL-controlled agents. For BipedalWalker, we check whether the RL-controlled walking agent falls (i.e., its head touches the ground).\""
