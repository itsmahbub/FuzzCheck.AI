  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility through rule-based constraints applied at each mutation step, which aligns with the 'Medium' rating. For each of the four experimental environments, the authors describe a specific mechanism to ensure that the mutated input state remains within a valid or 'legal' space, and they explicitly discard any states that violate these rules. For example, in the autonomous driving environment, the CARLA simulator is used to validate the mutated state, and in the aircraft collision avoidance system, states outside a predefined 'legal space' are discarded. However, the paper does not address the potential for cumulative drift, where a series of individually plausible mutations could lead to an overall unrealistic scenario. Furthermore, it lacks any empirical validation (such as human studies or quantitative metrics like LPIPS or SSIM) to confirm that the final crash-triggering scenarios are perceptually or semantically realistic.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.2.1 Autonomous Driving: 'We use the CARLA simulator itself to check for the validity of the mutated state. All illegally mutated states and the states that trigger initial collision are discarded in our experiments.'\nPage 7, Section 4.2.2 Aircraft Collision Avoidance: 'Given the predefined range of acceptable states, states that fall outside legal space are automatically discarded.'\nPage 7, Section 4.2.3 Video Game: 'With a clear definition of permissible positions and velocities, CUREFUZZ ignores any illegal states.'"
