  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight via statistical and input-structure analyses of discovered failures (counts by SUT and mutation type, severity buckets, time-series of inconsistencies, and manual inspection/false-positive rates), and it links many failures to input-level causes (occlusion/overlap, lighting, perspective mismatches, mutation type). However, it does not analyze observable model internals (neuron activations, coverage, layer/feature attributions) nor does it systematically connect failures to deeper model vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious features, explicit dataset bias, or overfitting. Thus it meets the criteria for Medium: statistical/failure-pattern and input-structure diagnostics but no internal-model diagnostics or causal linkage to underlying model vulnerabilities.",
  "evidence": "Page 1966, Section 6.3 Metrics: \"we rely on the Cityscapes benchmark evaluation tool (eval) which scores each SUT’s performance based on the percentage of correctly classified pixels... drop = eval(Percep(r), interp) - eval(Percep(r'), interp')\". Page 1966-1967, Section 6.4 RQ1 Results: \"Figure 11 shows the counts of inconsistencies found in each category per SUT... semImFuzz found 1210 SUT inconsistencies resulting from 884 mutations and that each SUT had over 100 inconsistencies.\" Page 1967, Figure 12 discussion: \"The leftmost column shows a moderate inconsistency; an added person occludes a bus, causing EfficientPS to then classify the bus as a train... The rightmost column shows an extreme inconsistency; an added car occludes a truck, causing EfficientPS to misclassify the truck...\". Page 1967, Section 6.4: \"To gain a better grasp on the rate of false positives we manually inspect all the generated test cases that led to 5+ p.p. drop, and sample 10% of the test cases that led to a drop between 1 and 5 p.p.\" and Table 2 (page 1967) reports false positive rates per SUT and severity buckets. Page 1968, Section 6.4.3 RQ3 Results: \"The add car mutation induced the most inconsistencies (877), followed by the add person mutation (280), and then the mutation to change the car color (53)... This suggests that editing large regions of the image, even in a conforming manner, is insufficient... high level semantic mutations such as adding a car are required to exercise these perception systems and find inconsistencies.\" Page 1964, Section 4.4.4 Discriminators: \"The discriminator learned to differentiate between the classes, but could not differentiate conforming versus nonconforming images.\" -- Nowhere in the design, implementation, or evaluation sections does the paper present analysis of internal model signals (e.g., neuron activations, layer-wise coverage, or feature-attribution analyses) or establish causal links from discovered failures to underlying vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious features or overfitting."
