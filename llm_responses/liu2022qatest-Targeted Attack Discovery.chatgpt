  "why": "QATest is a metamorphic, coverage-driven fuzzer that detects inconsistencies and generic erroneous behaviors (e.g., differing answers, <NoAnswer> vs answer, unrelated answers). Its oracle and bug definition are based on output inconsistency between a seed question and its semantically-equivalent transform (M(q') != M(q)). The guidance components (N-Gram coverage, perplexity priority, seed selection) steer generation toward diverse and authentic inputs, not toward attacker-chosen outputs or broader security classes (e.g., toxicity or jailbreaks). The paper contains no mechanism for specifying or steering the fuzzer to induce a particular target output or a security-class objective. Therefore the method performs untargeted exploration revealing generic failures rather than targeted attack discovery.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"It provides the first uniform solution to generate tests with oracle information automatically for various QA systems...\"; Page 4, Section 3.2.1 Test Oracle / Definition 3.1: \"Therefore, the QA system should output the same answer for the q and q'.\" and \"A mutant q' ∈ T(q) is regarded as a bug case of M if M(q') ≠ M(q).\"; Page 5, Section 3.3 Guidance Criteria Design: \"we propose two testing criteria as guidance in the test generation process... N-Gram coverage and perplexity priority...\" (criteria are about input coverage and authenticity rather than targeting outputs); Page 9, Section 5.4 Case Study: listing bug types such as \"(1) <NoAnswer> questions are answered with irrelevant content\" and \"(2) Answerable questions are answered with <NoAnswer>.\" (examples show generic erroneous behaviors rather than attacker-chosen target outputs)."
