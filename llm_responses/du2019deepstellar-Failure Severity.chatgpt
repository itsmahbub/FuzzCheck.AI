  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's DeepStellar framework is explicitly used to find and detect adversarial inputs that cause RNNs to produce incorrect or targeted outputs (e.g., targeted adversarial audio transcriptions and misclassifications). Those failures violate user intent and can produce undesired or unsafe outputs, which matches the \"Medium\" severity class. The paper does not claim to bypass explicit safety/policy or security mechanisms nor evaluate defended or safety-aligned models (no results on circumventing defenses, jailbreaks, data-exfiltration, or models with explicit safety mechanisms), so it does not meet the \"High\" category.",
  "evidence": "Page 477, Abstract: \"we design two algorithms powered by the quantitative measures for adversarial sample detection and coverage-guided test generation.\" \n\nPage 481, Section 5.1 (Adversarial Sample Detection): \"Adversarial sample detection aims to check whether a given input is an adversarial sample at runtime. We propose to use the trace similarity metrics to measure the behavioral differences between two inputs. Based on this idea, we develop a new approach to detect adversarial samples for RNNs.\" \n\nPage 483, Section 6.1 (Data Preparation): \"we generate 1,100 (100 seeds× 11 targets) adversarial audios, which took about 12 days in total ...\" (shows they generate targeted adversarial ASR examples). \n\nPage 484, Section 6.4 (Results): \"The results confirm that the trace similarity-based method is effective for adversarial sample detection under carefully selected abstraction configurations, with more than 89% prediction accuracy.\" \n\nPage 482, Section 6.1 (Models and Dataset / Table 1): lists standard pre-trained models used (e.g., \"we selected two versions of Mozilla pre-trained DeepSpeech\"), with no mention of testing or bypassing defended / safety-aligned models."
