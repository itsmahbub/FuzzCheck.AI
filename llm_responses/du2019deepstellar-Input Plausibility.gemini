  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method for coverage-guided testing explicitly aims to maintain semantic plausibility by using standard data augmentation and metamorphic mutation techniques. The transformations applied, such as brightness changes, rotation, scaling for images, and speed/volume adjustments for audio, are constrained by 'conservative parameters' to be 'slight and imperceptible'. This enforces plausibility between an input and its direct mutant, fitting the definition of 'bounded or rule-based constraints' for successive mutation steps. However, the fuzzing algorithm (Algorithm 2) follows an iterative process where mutated inputs are added back to a queue for further mutation. The paper does not describe any mechanism to check for or control the cumulative effect of these small perturbations over many iterations, which could cause the inputs to drift away from the original plausible distribution. The constraints are applied locally to each mutation step, but the global, long-term plausibility across the entire fuzzing process is not explicitly addressed.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5.2, Coverage-Guided Testing of RNNs: 'For CGT, we mainly focus on image classification and apply the metamorphic mutation strategy [55] for generating new mutants that would keep the prediction meaning from the human’s perspective during testing.'\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, Data Preparation: 'For both audio and image case, we set conservative parameters for transformation so that the perturbation on original samples is slight and imperceptible. Note that all the adversarial samples are also with minimal perturbations and not perceptible by human.'\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, Data Preparation: The paper lists the specific transformations used: 'image contrast, brightness, translation, scaling, shearing, rotation and add white noise' for images, and 'speed and volume adjustment, low/high-frequency filtering, noise blending' for audio. These are local, bounded transformations.\n\nPage 7, Algorithm 2: The algorithm describes a standard fuzzing loop where a mutated sample `a'` that increases coverage is added back to the test queue `Q` (`Q <- Q U a'`). This structure allows for mutations to accumulate over generations, but no step is included to check the accumulated deviation of `a'` from the original seed."
