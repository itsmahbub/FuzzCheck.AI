  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight via statistical analysis of failures (per‑ASR and per‑TTS failure counts, cumulative plots, FPR measurements) and a manual root‑cause categorization of false positives (TTS errors, preprocessing issues, ambiguous audio). However, it does not analyze observable model internals (e.g., neuron activation, layer behaviour, coverage) nor does it link discovered failures to deeper model vulnerabilities such as reliance on non‑robust/spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting. Thus it meets the criteria for Medium.",
  "evidence": "1) Statistical failure counts and per‑system comparisons: Section III.D (RQ3) and Table V report total failed cases per TTS/ASR: \"CrossASR generates 13,572, 13,071, 5,911, and 1,064 failed test cases using Google, ResponsiveVoice, Festival, and Espeak TTSes, respectively.\" (Section III.D / Table V). 2) Accuracy and false positive rates (quantitative diagnostics): Section III.D (RQ4) and Table VI show sampled FPRs per ASR/TTS and report manual verification: \"From all combination of TTSes and ASRs, the FPRs are low...\" (Section III.D, Table VI). 3) Manual analysis and categorization of failure causes: Section IV.B (Discussion) performs a diagnostic analysis of false positives and categorizes root causes into four cases (TTS problems, TTS producing unintelligible audio, text preprocessing limitations, and ambiguous audio): \"We analyze these false positives and observed that they can be categorized into 4 different cases: (1) ... (2) ... (3) ... (4) Audio is ambiguous; It can match both texts.\" (Section IV.B). 4) Explicit absence of internal/coverage analysis: the paper emphasizes a black‑box differential method and contrasts with coverage‑guided approaches: \"As a black-box approach, CrossASR can generate test cases for any ASR...\" and \"It differentiates itself from the many existing AI testing work that is coverage‑guided, e.g., [5], [8], [12].\" (Introduction / Section I). These excerpts show the paper provides statistical and root‑cause diagnostics but does not analyze model internals or tie failures to underlying model vulnerabilities, matching the Medium level."
