  "why": "The paper explicitly guides test generation toward predefined target classes (chosen by the tester) by minimizing the distribution difference (MMD) between a source-class test suite and the training data of a specified target class. DistXplore's objective, algorithm inputs, and experimental setup all use a target class c' as a steering signal, and the authors show that decreasing the MMD to a chosen target class increases the proportion of errors classified as that target (Error_target Rate). Thus the fuzzer actively steers exploration to induce attacker-chosen outputs (target labels) rather than performing untargeted fault discovery.",
  "evidence": "Page 71, Section 3.1.1 (Model Evaluation): \"Thus, DistXplore aims to generate test cases (in a class) that are statistically similar to the training data in other classes.\"; Page 71, Section 3.1.1 (definition): \"given a DNN f and a test suite S belonging to a source class c, we define its distribution difference with respect to the training data (T_{c'}) in another target class c' as: DF(S, c') = MMD(f(S), f(T_{c'}))\"; Page 72, Section 3.2 / Algorithm 1 (inputs): Algorithm 1 Input lists \"f : the target DNN, S : a seed test suite from class c, c' : the target class, phi : target distribution difference\" showing c' is an explicit algorithm input; Page 73, Section 4.1.4 (Experiment setup): \"For each class c, we run DistXplore multiple times (i.e., 9) by setting different target classes c' with Algo. 1. Finally, for each model, we run DistXplore 90 times (i.e., 10 source classes × 9 target classes).\"; Page 75, Section 4.2.1 (results / analysis): \"We collect the best chromosome S after each iteration and calculate: ... 4) Error_target Rate: the proportion of errors (in S) predicted as the target class ... The results show that, during the optimization, the distribution of S is getting closer to the training distribution of the target class (see MMD_target) ... Meanwhile, Error Rate and Error_target Rate are increasing, indicating that more errors are generated and gradually become statistically indistinguishable between the original class c and target class c'.\""
