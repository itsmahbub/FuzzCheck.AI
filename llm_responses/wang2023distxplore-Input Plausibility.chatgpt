  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper constrains mutations using bounded, rule-based image transformations (a \"conservative\" configuration based on prior work) and uses L_p distance notions to judge validity, which enforces plausibility at each mutation step. However, the method does not describe an explicit mechanism that enforces or monitors cumulative distance from the original seed across many GA iterations (no global bound or explicit plausibility-filtering of accumulated drift is described). The authors instead rely on per-mutation constraints and conservative parameter settings; empirical human validation shows high validity rates, but there is no described guarantee preventing accumulation of small per-step changes into semantically implausible inputs over many iterations. This matches the \"Medium\" grade: plausibility is enforced between successive mutation steps but cumulative/final drift across iterations is not explicitly constrained.",
  "evidence": "Page 70, Section 2.1.2 Data Validity: \"In practice, the l_p norm [40] is usually used to guarantee the validity of the generated data by the existing DL testing and adversarial attack techniques. Specifically, given a valid input x, the new test case x' generated by adding some perturbations on x is considered as valid if ||x' - x|| < ε, where ε is a safe radius.\" \n\nPage 71, Section 3.2 Distribution-Guided Test Generation: \"For each selected gene, the mutation randomly selects a transformation function to mutate it. To guarantee the validity of the generated inputs, we adopt the conservative strategy [63] that constrains the transformation with both 0 and ∞.\" \n\nPage 73, Section 4.1.4 Experiment Setup (Conﬁguration of DistXplore): \"To ensure the validity of the generated test cases, we adopt a more conservative configuration compared to DeepHunter [63] to constrain the mutation.\" \n\nPage 75, Section 4.2.2 RQ2: \"In order to evaluate the validity of the generated inputs, we conducted a manual investigation by randomly selecting 10,000 erroneous inputs ... The validity ratios were found to be 98.5%+, 96.5%+, 98.7%+, and 95.3%+ for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, respectively.\" \n\n(No section or quote describes enforcing a global/cumulative plausibility bound across GA iterations or filtering mutated inputs for accumulated drift away from the plausible input distribution.)"
