  "value": "High",
  "why": "The proposed method, PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement), generates adversarial inputs as text prompts. Text is an inherently discrete and serialized format. Unlike floating-point representations of images or audio, text prompts do not suffer from numerical instability caused by standard I/O operations like quantization, clipping, or rounding. A generated text prompt, when saved to disk and reloaded, remains identical, thus perfectly preserving the properties that induce the failure (the 'jailbreak'). The metric definition explicitly states that such approaches are considered highly reproducible: 'We also consider fuzzing approaches that generate inputs directly in serialized formats (e.g., synthesized speech, rendered images, or generated text) as reproducible under this metric, since such inputs are inherently stable with respect to standard I/O operations.' The paper consistently describes its output as semantic, interpretable text prompts, which fall directly into this category.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section II. PRELIMINARIES: 'We focus on prompt-level jailbreaks, wherein the goal is to craft semantic, human-interpretable prompts that fool a targeted LLM into outputting objectionable content.' This confirms that the adversarial inputs are text. Page 1, Abstract: '...we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks...'. The entire methodology revolves around generating and refining natural language prompts, which are inherently stable under standard I/O operations."
