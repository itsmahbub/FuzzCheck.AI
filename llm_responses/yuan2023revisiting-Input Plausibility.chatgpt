  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility constraints at each mutation step (rule-based validity checks adopted from prior work) and reports quantitative perceptual quality measures (Inception Score and FID) showing that NLC-guided, fault-inducing images remain natural-looking. However, the paper does not describe any explicit mechanism that prevents cumulative drift across many sequential fuzzing iterations (i.e., global/aggregate plausibility guarantees), nor does it report human studies; plausibility is enforced/checked per-step and validated empirically on final outputs via IS/FID only.",
  "evidence": "Sec. VI-B (Fuzzing setup) / page 1209: \"is_valid() is adopted from [47], which deems a mutation as valid if 1) the #changed-pixels is less than α× #pixels or 2) the maximum of changed pixel value is less than β ×255. We set α to 0.2 and β to 0.4.\" (Alg.1 and accompanying text show the per-step validity check is applied before adding a mutated input as a new seed).; Sec. VI-B (Naturalness of Mutations) / pages 1209–1210: \"We measure the naturalness of mutated inputs under each criterion; ... We use Inception Score (IS) [39] and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [18], which are widely used ... Overall, mutated images guided by NLC have the best scores for both IS and FID.\" (Table XI reports IS/FID values for NLC and other criteria).; There is no statement or section in the paper that introduces a global or cumulative-plausibility enforcement across fuzzing iterations (the algorithm checks is_valid(s_hat,s) relative to the immediate parent only, and mutated inputs are then added to the seed pool), implying cumulative drift across many bounded steps is not explicitly prevented nor analyzed."
