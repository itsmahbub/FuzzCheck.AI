  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight beyond merely reporting failures: it gives a model-informed explanation (Section 3.1) of why the proposed perturbations produce failures by relating them to convolutional kernel structure (the split into contiguous sign-based zones and the resulting amplified output change), and it analyzes statistical failure patterns in evaluation (Err-Num, Label-Num, SR, Inact-Rate). However, it does not present empirical analyses of internal neuron signals (no measured neuron coverage, activation frequency, or layer-by-layer activation statistics) nor does it connect discovered failures to broader sources such as dataset bias, spurious features, or overfitting. These facts match the metric’s Medium level: diagnostic insight via analysis of observable model internals/statistical failure patterns is present, but deeper internal/neuron-level or dataset-bias/spurious-feature attribution is absent.",
  "evidence": "p.166, Section 3.1 (Key Insight): \"A convolutional kernel can be split into multiple continuous zones where the corresponding weights have the same sign (+ or -). ... CNNs are prone to be affected by continuous perturbations.\"; p.166, Section 3.1 (analysis / equations): \"Since all elements in Ui have the same sign, we can induce that Ui × δcon_i is positive and is larger than |Ui × δdis_i|, which makes Dif_dis < Dif_con.\" (explains why continuous perturbations are more likely to change outputs and induce failures); p.170, Section 4.1 (Metrics): \"Err-Num. ... Label-Num. ... SR.\" (shows statistical analysis of failure patterns used in evaluation); p.172, Section 4.3 (Inact-Rate discussion): \"We use the inactivation rate (Inact-Rate) to reflect this problem and compare the inactivation rate for all methods.\"; p.165, Introduction / background: \"Without any inner knowledge of target models, black-box testing methods cannot measure the coverage but can only find error-inducing inputs with diversified labels.\" (indicating the paper does not measure neuron coverage or per-neuron activations)"
