  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate or demonstrate whether fault-inducing inputs discovered on one model also trigger failures in other models performing the same task, nor does it describe mechanisms intended to discover or encourage transferable attacks. All fuzzing and adversarial-example experiments are conducted per tested model (i.e., inputs are generated/assessed against the same target DNN), and the evaluation reports coverage/faults per model without reusing generated fault-inducing inputs across different model implementations. Thus the work does not address attack transferability.",
  "evidence": "VI.B (Guiding Input Mutation in DNN Testing), Alg. 1 (page 1209): \"Tested DNN: D; Criterion: C;\" — the fuzzing algorithm is defined in terms of a single tested DNN. \n\nVI.A.2 (Fault-Revealing Capability of Test Suites) (page 1208): \"AEs are generated using the training data (see 'Clarification' below for results of AEs generated using test data), and all algorithms attacking the three models reach over 98% success rates.\" — adversarial examples are generated and evaluated against the same model(s) they attack. \n\nVI (Evaluation) and Tables (e.g., Table VI, Table VII) (pages 1206–1208): All reported results present coverage and faults per model (ResNet, VGG, MobileNet, BigGAN, etc.), with no experiment or section reporting reuse of fault-inducing inputs across different models or measurements of transferability. (No section title or experiment in the paper addresses transferability or substitute-model attacks.)"
