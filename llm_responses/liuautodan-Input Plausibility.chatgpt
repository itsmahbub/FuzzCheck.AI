  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility locally and validates final jailbreak prompts quantitatively, but does not impose an explicit end-to-end plausibility constraint across successive mutation iterations. AutoDAN’s design includes plausibility-preserving components (LLM-based diversification/mutation, initialization from handcrafted prompts, synonym/momentum word operations) that operate at individual mutation/initialization steps, and the authors report Sentence Perplexity (PPL) scores for the final prompts to demonstrate semantic realism. However, termination is driven by max-iterations or refusal-keyword detection rather than an explicit cumulative plausibility constraint, and the paper does not report a human study of prompt naturalness nor continuous measures that enforce plausibility across the entire evolutionary trajectory (e.g., iterative drift control). These facts match the metric definition for \"Medium\": local enforcement or final-input validation but no end-to-end enforcement across fuzzing iterations.",
  "evidence": "Sec. 3.2 Population Initialization (p. 4): \"we employ LLMs as the agents responsible for revising the prototype prompt... the modifications proposed by LLM can preserve the inherent logical flow and meaning of the original sentences\"; Sec. 3.4 (Sentence-level: momentum word scoring) (p. 5): describes synonym replacement and momentum word scoring to guide local word-level changes; Sec. 3.5 Termination Criteria (p. 5): \"If the algorithm has exhausted the maximum number of iterations or no keyword in a set list Lrefuse is detected in the LLM’s top K words of its response, AutoDAN will terminate\" (shows termination is not based on cumulative plausibility); Sec. 4.1 Metrics (p. 6): \"For stealthiness, we use standard Sentence Perplexity (PPL) evaluated by GPT-2 as the metric.\"; Sec. 4.2 Attack Effectiveness and Stealthiness (p. 6): \"we share the standardized Sentence Perplexity (PPL) score... Compared with the baseline, our method exhibits superior performance in terms of PPL, indicating more semantically meaningful and stealthy attacks being generated.\" (Table 1 shows PPL results)."
