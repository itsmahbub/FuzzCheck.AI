  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by measuring and using observable model-internal signals (neuron-level coverage metrics KMNC and NBC) as part of the search fitness and by reporting statistical patterns of failures (coverage achieved and numbers of errors across environmental types and error bounds). However, it does not explain why failures occur in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities (e.g., reliance on non-robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting) nor does it analyze specific neuron characteristics or layers to link failures to root causes. Therefore the work meets the criterion for Medium but not High.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.2.1 \"TESTING COVERAGE CRITERIA\": \"In this work, we employ DNN coverage criteria to measure the ability of a style vector to detect diverse erroneous behaviours... we carefully select two fine-grained coverage metrics on the sub-neuron level (Ma et al., 2018) for TACTIC to support, i.e., k-multisection Neuron Coverage (KMNC) and Neuron Boundary Coverage (NBC).\"; Page 5, Section 3.2.3 \"FITNESS FUNCTION DEFINITION\": \"F(s) = wc * Fc(s) + wd * norm(Fd(s)), where s is a style vector... Fc(s) = |Rs|/|Rt| ... Fd(s) = 1/|Io| sum_{x in Io} |f(x) - f(g(x,s))|.\"; Page 6, Section 4.2 \"Comparison with Baselines on Effectiveness\": \"Table 1 and Table 2 summarise the results of comparing TACTICNBC with Rc and DeepRoad, respectively... In terms of the achieved coverage, compared with Rc, TACTIC achieves higher coverage in all environmental types... In terms of the detected erroneous behaviours, compared with Rc and DeepRoad, TACTIC detects many more erroneous behaviours in all environmental types for both four error bounds.\" (Table 1 entries example) \"NBC 35.92% 3.18% ... NUMBER OF ERRORS 10° 18675.1 2971.2 ...\"; Page 8, Conclusion: \"Large-scale experiments demonstrate that TACTIC can effectively identify critical environmental conditions and synthesise realistic testing driving scenes. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, TACTIC can reveal more diverse and more erroneous behaviours for the popular DNN-based ADSs, and meanwhile, reach a satisfactory testing coverage.\" (no accompanying analysis linking failures to underlying model vulnerabilities)"
