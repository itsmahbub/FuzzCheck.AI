  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's proposed method, TACTIC, uses a GAN-based image-to-image translation model (MUNIT) to apply semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations, specifically altering the environmental conditions (e.g., weather, time of day) of driving scenes. According to the metric definition, using such transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization (e.g., quantization, clipping) is categorized as 'Medium'. The paper does not describe any steps to ensure that the pixel-level changes introduced by the GAN would persist after standard I/O operations, such as saving the image to an 8-bit format like PNG. The focus is on the realism and bug-finding effectiveness of the generated scenes, but there is no mention of constraining the mutations or verifying the oracle's findings post-serialization to account for potential loss of fault-inducing perturbations.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section 3.1, Environmental Conditions: \"To encode the environmental condition space of an environmental type, we leverage MUNIT, a multimodal unsupervised image-to-image translation framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).\" This confirms the use of a generative model for transformation. \n\nPage 5, Figure 4: This figure illustrates the semantic nature of the transformations, showing an original scene transformed into 'Rain' and 'Snow in Daytime' versions. \n\nThe paper's methodology sections (3. The TACTIC Approach) and evaluation sections (4. Experimental Evaluation) lack any discussion of handling serialization effects. The metamorphic oracle described in Section 3.2.2 operates on the generated scene `xt` directly, without any mention of an intermediate serialization step to confirm the failure's persistence."
