  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight into the discovered failures by analyzing observable model internals, specifically the neuron activation patterns. The authors demonstrate that crash-triggering state sequences induce neuron activation patterns that are distinctly different from those of normal or randomly mutated sequences. This analysis links the failures to the model's 'abnormal internal logics'. The paper visualizes these distinct activation clusters using t-SNE plots (Figure 9) and uses this insight to build a detector for abnormal behaviors, thus characterizing the failures beyond merely reporting them. This aligns with the 'Medium' criterion, which includes providing insight through the analysis of neuron characteristics.",
  "evidence": "Page 11, Section 7.3, RQ3: Root Cause Analysis: 'Setup. Inspired by contemporary DNN testing criteria [58, 67, 71, 91], we characterize crash-triggering states by measuring their induced neuron activation patterns in all tested models.' and 'Results. ... The neuron activations of crash-triggering state sequences found by MDPFuzz have a clear boundary with normal and randomly mutated sequences, which shows that the crash-triggering states can trigger the models’ abnormal internal logics.' and 'Answer to RQ3: Though crash-triggering initial states are considered normal from the MDP environments’ perspective, they induce distinct neuron activation patterns. This shows that MDPFuzz can cover the model’s corner internal logics and trigger its abnormal behaviors more efficiently than randomly-mutated state sequences.'"
