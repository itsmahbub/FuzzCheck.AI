  "why": "The paper’s coverage-guided generation and mutation processes do not enforce or measure input plausibility across iterations, nor do the authors report any human evaluation or task-specific perceptual/linguistic metrics (e.g., Perplexity used as a plausibility check) for the final fault-inducing inputs. Generated attack queries are produced via LLM rewriting (GPT-4) or by appending adversarial suffixes (GCG), and selection is based solely on coverage increase, with no mechanism described to constrain cumulative drift or to filter for semantic/naturalness. While the authors use perplexity-based methods as baselines for jailbreak detection, they do not use such measures to ensure that fuzzed/generated inputs remain realistic; likewise, no human study or quantitative plausibility metrics (e.g., Perplexity reported for final examples, LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI) are reported. Therefore the work does not enforce or assess input plausibility as required by the metric.",
  "evidence": "III-A Motivation (page 732): \"Attack queries are generated by appending adversarial suffixes to rejected queries using GCG [7]. These queries aim to trigger the model to output malicious content (i.e., abnormal behaviors).\" \n\nV.C Jailbreak Case Generation (page 739): \"Over five iterations, GPT-4 generates ten new jailbreak queries per round through prompt rewriting. The query with the highest coverage increase is selected as the next seed in the coverage-guided approach.\" \n\nV.A Baseline (page 738-739): \"Baseline: We select the most widely used perplexity filter [33], the state-of-the-art method PARDEN [35], and self-reminder [49] as baselines for comparison.\" (shows perplexity is used as a baseline detector, not as an enforced plausibility constraint for generated inputs)\n\nEvaluation / General (pages 736-740, various): No sections or reported results describe human evaluation or quantitative perceptual/linguistic measures (e.g., Perplexity reported for generated fault-inducing prompts or other task-specific plausibility scores); coverage-guided selection is driven by coverage increase alone."
