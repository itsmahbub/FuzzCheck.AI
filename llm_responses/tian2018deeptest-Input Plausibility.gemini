  "why": "The paper's method, DeepTest, is explicitly designed around generating synthetic inputs that mimic plausible, real-world driving conditions. It uses a set of specific image transformations such as adding rain, fog, altering brightness, and applying affine transformations (rotation, scaling, etc.) to seed images. This constitutes a rule-based constraint on mutations to maintain plausibility. However, the test generation process is iterative; a transformed image that increases neuron coverage is used as a new seed for further transformations. The paper does not describe any mechanism to monitor or constrain the cumulative effect of these sequential transformations. An image could be repeatedly rotated, scaled, or darkened, potentially drifting into a state that is no longer semantically plausible within the driving domain. This design choice enforces plausibility at each individual step but overlooks the potential for cumulative drift across multiple iterations.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2, 'Increasing Coverage with Synthetic Images': 'Therefore, DeepTest focuses on generating realistic synthetic images by applying image transformations on seed images and mimic different real-world phenomena like camera lens distortions, object movements, different weather conditions, etc. To this end, we investigate nine different realistic image transformations (changing brightness, changing contrast, translation, scaling, horizontal shearing, rotation, blurring, fog effect, and rain effect).'\n\nPage 6, Section 3.3, 'Algorithm 1: Greedy search for combining image transformations to increase neuron coverage': The algorithm shows an iterative process where a newly generated image is pushed back onto a stack to serve as a seed for further transformations if it increases coverage: 'if covInc(newimage) then ... genTest = genTests U newimage S.push(newImage)'. This loop does not include a check for the cumulative effect of transformations on input plausibility; decisions are guided solely by neuron coverage increase."
