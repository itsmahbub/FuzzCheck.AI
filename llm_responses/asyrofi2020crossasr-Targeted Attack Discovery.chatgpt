  "why": "CrossASR performs untargeted differential testing that looks for mismatches between an ASR's transcription and the original text (using other ASRs as reference). While it uses a failure-probability predictor to prioritize texts likely to produce failures, the objective is to discover generic misrecognitions (failed test cases) rather than to steer the ASR toward specific, attacker-chosen outputs or phrases. The paper explicitly contrasts CrossASR with adversarial/targeted attack work and describes its oracle as detecting mismatches to the input text, not achieving attacker-specified target outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 640, Abstract: \"CrossASR is a differential testing solution that compares outputs of multiple ASR systems to uncover erroneous behaviors among ASRs.\" \n\nPage 641, Section II-A (Architecture): \"These ASR-transcribed texts are compared with the text that was input to the TTS. For each ASR, if the ASR-transcribed text matches with the text input to TTS... If the ASR-transcribed text does not match the text input to TTS and there is another ASR’s transcribed text that matches with the text input to TTS, CrossASR determines the speech audio as a failed test case. We consider cases where all ASRs’ transcribed texts differ from the input text as indeterminable cases – as possibly the error resides in the TTS.\" \n\nPage 648-649, Section V.A (ASR Testing, related work): \"From the artificial intelligence community, there are several works that perform adversarial attacks targeting ASR systems (a.k.a. adversarial test case generation) [20]–[25]. ... Different from these works, CrossASR performs differential testing by cross-referencing different ASRs as test oracle. Also, CrossASR is concerned in assessing correctness of ASRs instead of their robustness.\" \n\nPage 640-641, Introduction: \"CrossASR achieves its efficiency by using a failure probability predictor to select texts that are likely to lead to failed test cases...\" (shows prioritization of likely failures, not selection of attacker-specified target outputs)."
