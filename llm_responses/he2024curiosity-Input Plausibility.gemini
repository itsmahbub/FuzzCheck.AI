  "why": "The paper's methodology explicitly and consistently enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process by ensuring mutated inputs remain within a valid, domain-specific distribution. The authors state a general principle of verifying the validity of each mutated seed. For each of the four distinct experimental environments (autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, video games, robotics), they detail a specific mechanism to discard illegal or implausible states. These mechanisms include using the simulator's own validation checks, adhering to predefined legal ranges for physical properties (e.g., speed, position), and using known sets of valid environmental configurations. This approach prevents the fuzzer from exploring unrealistic scenarios that could lead to irrelevant failures, directly aligning with the highest standard for the metric.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.4, Seed Mutation: \"We need to ensure that the mutated seed lies in the legitimate state spaces, and the mutated seed would not trigger an initial crash. In our experiments, we have carefully addressed this concern and verified the validity of each mutated seed, details are given in Section 4.\"\nPage 7, Section 4.2.1, Autonomous Driving: \"We use the CARLA simulator itself to check for the validity of the mutated state. All illegally mutated states and the states that trigger initial collision are discarded in our experiments.\"\nPage 7, Section 4.2.2, Aircraft Collision Avoidance: \"Given the predefined range of acceptable states, states that fall outside legal space are automatically discarded.\"\nPage 7, Section 4.2.3, Video Game: \"With a clear definition of permissible positions and velocities, CUREFUZZ ignores any illegal states.\"\nPage 7, Section 4.2.4, BipedalWalker: \"Since the valid ground types are known, illegal states can be easily detected and discarded.\""
