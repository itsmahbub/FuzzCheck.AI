  "value": "High",
  "why": "LipFuzzer generates mutated inputs as serialized audio (via Text-to-Speech / phoneme-to-speech) and uses those synthesized audio files as the actual test inputs to VA devices, and the paper describes verifying failures by playing the synthesized audio and observing the VA response. Because inputs are generated directly in a serialized format (audio) and the verification/oracle uses those serialized artifacts, the fault-inducing perturbations are preserved across I/O (serialization) and the paper explicitly accounts for this in both test-generation and oracle evaluation. This matches the metric's criterion that approaches which generate inputs directly in serialized formats are reproducible under standard I/O operations.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, 'Our Approach' (Section I): \"...we input mutated voice commands to VA devices by using machine speech synthesis to eliminate the human factor of producing ASR-related misinterpretation.\" \n\nPage 8, 'C. Template Fuzzing' (Verification): \"We verify if a LAPSUS is effective by testing the synthesis audio with Alexa. To do that, we first synthesize speech from generated LAPSUS voice commands. Then we monitor the response of the VA. ... We define that a LAPSUS is verified to be effective when it is incorrectly interpreted by the VA system.\" \n\nPage 9, 'V. IMPLEMENTATION / Speech Synthesis': \"...we use two types of speech synthesis methods to generate LAPSUS. ... We use each vApp platforms’ native speech synthesis tools: Amazon Polly [6] and Google Cloud TTS [9]. ... The second speech synthesis method is for vocabulary and grammar levels. We direct input fuzzing results generated with LipFuzzer to the above mentioned services and perform a Text-to-Speech conversion.\" \n\nPage 11, 'VI.A Intent Classifier Evaluation' (Experiment Setup/verification): \"...we synthesize audios (so that ASR processing is guaranteed to be correct) to the Amazon Echo device to check if the semantic inconsistency still exists.\""
