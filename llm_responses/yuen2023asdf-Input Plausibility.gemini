  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's method, ASDF, incorporates rule-based constraints to maintain plausibility but does not guarantee that the final generated audio inputs are realistic. Plausibility is enforced at the text level through transformations like changing tense or substituting homophones, which are designed to produce semantically valid sentences. Furthermore, a filtering mechanism is employed where a transformed text is only considered valid if at least one Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system under test can transcribe it correctly. This acts as a proxy for plausibility, discarding inputs that are completely nonsensical. However, the framework's core limitation, as acknowledged by the authors, is its reliance on a Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine. The paper explicitly states that the generated audio may not be interchangeable with real human speech due to differences in pronunciation, accent, and tone. This aligns with the 'Medium' rating, as there are rule-based constraints (text transformations and oracle-based filtering) but the system overlooks the cumulative effect of the entire generation process (TTS synthesis) on the final audio's realism.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section IV, 'Usage': 'It is important to note that cross-referencing is used to filter the low-quality, unrealistic texts resulting from text transformation. A transformed text input must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR service to be deemed valid (or determinable); otherwise, it is deemed indeterminable and discarded.'\n\nPage 2, Section V, 'Challenges and Future Work': 'ASDF generates an audio test suite using a TTS library. This assumes that the generated audio is interchangeable with the real-world speech of humans, which may not be the case in real-life situations. There would still be differences between human speech and computer-generated audio, namely pronunciation, accent, and tone.'"
