  "why": "The paper proposes a coverage-guided testing method called TESTRNN, which is a white-box approach that generates test cases to maximize structural coverage for a specific RNN model under test. The methodology is designed to operate on a single model at a time. The experimental evaluation, including the comparison of model robustness in Table V, applies the test generation process independently to different models to compare their individual robustness characteristics (e.g., number of adversarial samples found). The paper does not contain any experiments where fault-inducing inputs generated for one model are used to test a different model to assess transferability. Furthermore, the test generation algorithm is guided by internal coverage metrics of the specific model being tested and does not incorporate any mechanisms designed to promote the discovery of transferable attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 11, Section VII-C, Table V and accompanying text: The paper evaluates the robustness of two different models per task (e.g., Model 1 and Model 2 for MNIST). However, the methodology described involves running the test generation process separately for each model to compare their individual vulnerability. The text explains the goal as comparing models: \"For a set of trained models, we pursue the model, the test suite of which contains less amount of adversarial samples and unique adversarial samples. For example, we pick up model 2 for Lipophilicity prediction, since the values of two indicators are way smaller than that of model 1.\" This indicates a comparison of the models' robustness via separate testing runs, not a test of attack transferability between them."
