  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper includes an explicit experiment in which fault-inducing inputs generated by fuzzing a 32-bit MNIST classifier are reused to test a 16-bit quantized version, demonstrating that many of these inputs transfer and cause disagreements. This satisfies the criterion of reusing fuzzed inputs across two models performing the same task. However, the overall fuzzing framework is presented as a general CGF+PBT tool rather than being specifically designed to discover transferable failures across arbitrary surrogate and target models, so it lacks an explicit architectural mechanism for transferability beyond this illustrative application.",
  "evidence": "Section 6, “TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions’: “We then ran the fuzzer with mutations restricted to lie in a radius 0.4 infinity norm ball surrounding the seed images, using the activations of only the 32-bit model as coverage. ... With these settings, the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried.”"
