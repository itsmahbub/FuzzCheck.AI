  "value": "High",
  "why": "DLFuzz enforces input plausibility across iterations by measuring perturbation relative to the original seed and keeping only mutated inputs whose l2 distance to the original remains below a small threshold (they state < 0.02). The algorithm explicitly computes l2_distance = distance(x', x) and uses that value as a criterion for whether to keep a mutated input as a seed for further fuzzing. The paper also states the perturbations are restricted to be invisible and reports manual inspection found no inputs whose identity changed. These design choices prevent cumulative drift away from the plausible input distribution and thus enforce plausibility throughout fuzzing iterations.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 Algorithm (page 741): Algorithm 1 lines 15-16: \"l2_distance = distance(x′, x) //measure the perturbation\" and \"if coverage improved by x′ is desired and l2_distance is small then seed_list.append(x′)\"; same section (page 741): \"DLFuzz limits our desired distance to a relatively small range (less than 0.02) to ensure the imperceptibility.\" Section 3.1 Architecture (page 740-741): \"The minute perturbation is restricted to be invisible and ensures the prediction results before and after the mutation to be the same.\" Section 4.3 Discussion (page 742): \"For confirmation, we checked all the 366 adversarial inputs generated by DLFuzz, though DLFuzz maintains quite small l2 distance by the restricted threshold. We haven’t found any adversarial inputs that have already changed their identities after mutation.\""
