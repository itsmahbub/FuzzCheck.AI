  "why": "The paper's methodology is explicitly designed to maintain the plausibility and semantic integrity of the fuzzer's inputs. The authors identify the shortcomings of traditional mutation techniques, which can produce \"syntactically incorrect or semantically nonsensical inputs\" when applied to natural language. To overcome this, their core mutation strategy leverages LLMs to perform all transformations (Generate, Crossover, Expand, Shorten, Rephrase). This design inherently ensures that mutated inputs remain within the plausible distribution of coherent, human-readable text throughout all fuzzing iterations. Furthermore, the paper provides empirical evidence to support this claim by presenting multiple examples of mutated templates and explicitly stating that this is done to \"showcase that the newly generated templates can maintain their semantic integrity\". These examples serve as qualitative validation that the final fault-inducing inputs remain semantically realistic.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 3.3 Mutation: \"Directly applying these techniques [traditional program fuzzing] to natural language inputs can result in syntactically incorrect or semantically nonsensical inputs, which are unlikely to be effective in jailbreaking LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce distinct mutation methods that leverage LLMs themselves to assist in the mutation process. LLMs, with their proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text, offer a promising approach for crafting coherent and contextually relevant mutations... In order to showcase that the newly generated templates can maintain their semantic integrity and diversify our template collection, Figure 3 presents several post-mutated templates.\""
