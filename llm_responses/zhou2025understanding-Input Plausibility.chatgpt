  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper’s coverage-guided generation uses iterative prompt rewriting (GPT-4) and selects candidates by coverage increase, but it does not describe any mechanism that enforces input plausibility across iterations (no bounded perturbation, semantic-similarity constraint, or plausibility filter). Aside from manual verification for the synonymous-paraphrase dataset, the generation pipeline (seed → GPT-4 rewrites → coverage-based selection) has no stated checks that mutated queries remain within a realistic/semantically valid distribution over multiple iterations. Therefore the method allows iterative drift without explicit plausibility enforcement and falls under the 'Low' category.",
  "evidence": "Page 739, Section V.C \"Jailbreak Case Generation\" — \"Setup: We use Llama-2-7b-chat as the target model, initializing with five jailbreak queries as seeds. Over five iterations, GPT-4 generates ten new jailbreak queries per round through prompt rewriting. The query with the highest coverage increase is selected as the next seed in the coverage-guided approach. For comparison, a random strategy selects seeds randomly from rewritten candidates. Each method ultimately generates 250 new jailbreak queries to evaluate effectiveness.\" \n\nPage 734, Section III-A (Test Suite Construction, Synonymous Query Dataset) — \"To construct synonymous queries, we use GPT-4 to generate corresponding synonymous paraphrases for the first 500 queries from the Alpaca-gpt4 dataset and manually verify that the synonymous queries produce outputs similar to the original queries...\" \n\nInterpretation: The paper explicitly documents manual plausibility checking only for the synonymous-paraphrase dataset, but for the iterative coverage-guided jailbreak generation it describes GPT-4 rewrite+coverage selection without any described plausibility constraints or filtering across iterations, indicating no enforcement of sustained input plausibility throughout fuzzing iterations."
