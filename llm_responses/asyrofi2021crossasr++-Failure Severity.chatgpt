  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper defines and evaluates failures solely as recognition mismatches discovered via differential (cross-referencing) testing—i.e., cases where the system under test transcription does not match the original text while another ASR does, or cases deemed indeterminable due to TTS. All technical descriptions, workflow, and experiments focus on counting such failed test cases (robustness/misprediction errors). The paper does not describe uncovering unsafe/undesired outputs (e.g., toxic/bias/hallucination), nor any attempt to bypass safety, policy, or security mechanisms or to elicit data leakage or unauthorized actions in defended or safety-aligned models.",
  "evidence": "Section 1 (Introduction), p.1575: \"If the transcribed text recognized by the ASR system under test does not match the text input to TTS while another ASR’s transcribed text does, this input audio is viewed as a failed test case.\"; Section 2.1 (Workflow), p.1576: \"For a piece of audio and its corresponding transcription, there are three possible situations: 1) if the SUT can recognize it successfully, i.e. the transcript matches the original text... 2) If the SUT fails to recognize the audio file successfully, but at least one of the other ASR systems succeeds, we take this audio file (and the corresponding input text) as a failed test case for the SUT. 3) If all the ASR systems cannot recognize the audio correctly, we call it an indeterminable test case...\"; Section 3 (Experiments), p.1577: evaluation reports only counts of \"failed test cases\" (e.g., \"CrossASR++ can find 26.2% more failed test cases than the original tool\"), with no discussion of safety-policy bypasses or high-severity failures."
