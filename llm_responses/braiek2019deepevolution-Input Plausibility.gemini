  "why": "The paper's method, DeepEvolution, explicitly incorporates mechanisms to enforce input plausibility throughout the test generation process and provides empirical evidence that the resulting inputs are realistic. Plausibility is enforced in two ways: 1) by manually tuning the parameter ranges for metamorphic transformations to ensure they are 'semantically-preserving', and 2) by using a quantitative perceptual quality metric, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), to filter and reject any generated inputs that fall below a tuned similarity threshold. This use of SSIM directly addresses the metric's criteria for using task-specific quantitative measures. Furthermore, the paper provides empirical evidence of the final inputs' plausibility by stating that the authors manually verified a statistically significant sample of the generated images and confirmed their correctness.",
  "evidence": "Page 456, Section IV.A, 'To verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original inputs, we compute a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [8] which assesses the similarity between two images based on the visual impact of three characteristics: luminance, contrast, and structure... Therefore, we reject mutated synthetic inputs for which SSIM values are lower than a tuned threshold.'\n\nPage 458, Section VI. Threats to Validity, 'The manual tuning of metamorphic transformations’ domain and the threshold of SSIM could affect the validity of our results. To mitigate this threat, we selected a sample of our generated images using a confidence level of 95% and an error margin of 5%, and verified them manually. We found them to be correct.'"
