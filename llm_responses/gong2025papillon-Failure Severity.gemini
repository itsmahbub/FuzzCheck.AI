  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper introduces PAPILLON, a fuzz testing framework explicitly designed to generate jailbreak prompts that bypass the safety and policy mechanisms of large language models (LLMs). The goal is to induce the models to produce harmful or offensive content, which constitutes a high-impact security failure. The evaluation is specifically conducted on safety-aligned models (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-2-chat) and explicitly tests the method's resilience against several state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, including Perplexity Filters, SmoothLLM, and Llama Guard. The paper demonstrates that PAPILLON achieves a high attack success rate even when these explicit safety safeguards are in place, directly meeting the criteria for the 'High' severity rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 14, Section 6.3 Llama Guard: \"Llama Guard [17] is a safeguard model based on the Llama-2-7B architecture, designed to classify prompts and outputs in AI-human interactions as “safe” or “unsafe”. Unsafe prompts are filtered to defend against jailbreak attempts. In our study, we targeted LLMs equipped with Llama Guard, with results presented in Table 6. The experimental findings reveal that we can achieve a high attack success rate even under Llama Guard’s defense.\"\n\nPage 14, Section 6.4 Hybrid Defense: \"In addition to single defenses, we also consider two combinations of multiple defenses, referred to as hybrid defenses... Hybrid defenses generally provide stronger protection than single defenses. However, PAPILLON still achieves a high attack success rate in such cases.\""
