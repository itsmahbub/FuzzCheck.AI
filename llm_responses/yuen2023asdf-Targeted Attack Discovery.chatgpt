  "why": "The ASDF framework performs untargeted differential testing: it generates audio from input texts (including transformed variants) and flags failures when an ASR's transcription does not match the original text or when one ASR succeeds while another fails. The tool's transformations (tense changes, homophone substitution, augmentation, etc.) are used to expand the input space and increase the number of mis-transcriptions discovered, not to steer the ASR toward specific attacker-chosen outputs or phrases. There is no mechanism described that aims to induce a particular predetermined output (e.g., a chosen phrase, command, or label); instead the oracle checks for mismatches versus the input text or cross-referenced ASR outputs, consistent with untargeted exploration.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (page 461): \"ASDF generates more high-quality test cases by applying various text transformation methods (e.g., changing tense) to the input text in a failed test case.\"; II. TOOL DESIGN (page 461): \"If there exists at least one system that can correctly transcribe the audio while a specific ASR system fails to do so, we say that a failed test case is uncovered for this specific ASR system.\"; IV. USAGE (page 462): \"A failed text is defined as an audio file that is incorrectly transcribed by at least one ASR system.\" and \"Cross-referencing is used to filter the low-quality, unrealistic texts resulting from text transformation. A transformed text input must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR service to be deemed valid (or determinable); otherwise, it is deemed indeterminable and discarded.\"; III. CORE FUNCTIONALITIES (page 462): \"The Homophone Transformation method first identifies the homophone of the error-inducing term of the failed test case... This new sentence will be used as the new test case.\""
