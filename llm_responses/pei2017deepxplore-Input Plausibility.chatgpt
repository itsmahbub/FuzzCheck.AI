  "why": "DeepXplore enforces domain-specific, rule-based constraints and explicitly modifies gradients so that each iterative update satisfies realism constraints (e.g., pixel ranges, limited lighting/occlusion transforms, only adding manifest features). These measures constrain plausibility between successive mutation steps. However, the paper describes this as a per-iteration, rule-based enforcement (modify gradient so xi+1 satisfies constraints) and does not present a distribution-level or manifold-projection mechanism that guarantees the mutated input remains within a global plausible input distribution over many iterations (i.e., it does not address cumulative drift beyond per-step constraint checks). Therefore the work enforces plausibility between successive mutation steps but overlooks cumulative effects across many iterations.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.2 (DeepXplore algorithm), p. 6: \"Note that the seed input xseed = x0 always satisfy the constraints by definition, our technique must ensure that after i-th (i > 0) iteration of gradient ascent, xi still satisfies the constraints. Our algorithm ensures this property by modifying the gradient дrad (line 13 in Algorithm 1) such that xi+1 = xi + s · дrad still satisfies the constraints (s is the step size in the gradient ascent).\"\n\nSection 4.2 (DeepXplore algorithm), p. 6: \"While some such constraints can be efficiently embedded into the joint optimization process using the Lagrange Multipliers ..., we found that the majority of them cannot be easily handled by the optimization algorithm. Therefore, we designed a simple rule-based method to ensure that the generated tests satisfy the custom domain-specific constraints.\"\n\nSection 6.2 (Domain-specific constraints), p. 9: \"DeepXplore used three different types of constraints for simulating different environment conditions of images: (1) lighting effects for simulating different intensities of lights, (2) occlusion by a single small rectangle for simulating an attacker potentially blocking some parts of a camera, and (3) occlusion by multiple tiny black rectangles for simulating effects of dirt on camera lens.\""
