  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper does not provide empirical evidence, such as human studies or quantitative perceptual metrics (e.g., PESQ, STOI), to confirm that the final fault-inducing audio inputs are realistic. In fact, the authors explicitly acknowledge this as a limitation, stating that the Text-To-Speech (TTS) generated audio may not be interchangeable with real human speech. However, the method does not completely ignore plausibility. It incorporates an indirect validation mechanism through cross-referencing, where a transformed input is only considered valid if at least one ASR system under test can transcribe it correctly. This step is explicitly designed to filter out \"low-quality, unrealistic texts.\" This filtering of final inputs aligns with the criteria for a 'Medium' rating, as it constitutes a form of plausibility validation without enforcing it throughout the generation process or providing direct realism measurements.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section IV. USAGE: \"It is important to note that cross-referencing is used to filter the low-quality, unrealistic texts resulting from text transformation. A transformed text input must be transcribed correctly by at least one ASR service to be deemed valid (or determinable); otherwise, it is deemed indeterminable and discarded.\"\n\nPage 2, Section V. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE WORK: \"ASDF generates an audio test suite using a TTS library. This assumes that the generated audio is interchangeable with the real-world speech of humans, which may not be the case in real-life situations. There would still be differences between human speech and computer-generated audio, namely pronunciation, accent, and tone.\""
