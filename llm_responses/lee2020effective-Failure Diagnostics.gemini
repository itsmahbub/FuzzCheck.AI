  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by analyzing observable model internals and their correlation with the discovery of failures (adversarial inputs). Section 4.4, \"Learned Insights\", is dedicated to analyzing which neuron characteristics (e.g., layer position, connection types, weight values, activation history) are most important for creating effective neuron-selection strategies to find failures. This is a direct analysis of model internals to understand the failure discovery process. Additionally, Section 4.3 analyzes the statistical correlation between coverage metrics and the variety of adversarial inputs found. However, it does not extend this analysis to explain the failures in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities like spurious features or dataset bias, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 11, Section 4.4, Learned Insights: \"f4, which indicates the layers located in the back 25% of the network, is learned as the most important feature that neurons to select should have, and f2, which indicates the layers located relatively front of the network, is included in bottom-3 features in most cases (LeNet-4, LeNet-5, and ResNet-50). This trend indicates that neurons with higher expressive ability, which means that neurons are located in deeper convolutional layers [38], should be selected while testing the deep neural networks.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 4.3, Correlation between Coverage and Adversarial Inputs: \"From Figure 1 and Table 3, we can notice that coverage and variety of labels are highly correlated, while coverage and the number of adversarial inputs are not correlated strongly. In testing VGG-19 with NC, the order of coverage value of each technique exactly matches the order of the number of the labels found by each technique.\""
