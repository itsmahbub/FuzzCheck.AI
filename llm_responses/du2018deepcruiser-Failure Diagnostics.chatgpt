  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight based on observable model internals and statistical failure patterns: it constructs an abstract state-transition model (PCA-based state abstraction + MDP transition probabilities), defines multiple coverage metrics (state- and transition-level), and empirically analyzes correlations between state-coverage / state-variation (Jaccard Index) and erroneous behavior (WER). These analyses give useful diagnostic signals (e.g., which abstract states/transitions/test transformations correlate with higher WER) and show that increasing coverage exposes more errors. However, the paper does not perform root-cause or vulnerability attribution that explains why failures occur in terms of underlying model vulnerabilities (e.g., reliance on non-robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting). Therefore the work goes beyond mere reporting of failures but stops short of explanatory diagnostic analysis linking failures to underlying causes, matching the definition of Medium.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3 (Overview): \"The abstract model construction module takes a trained RNN as input and analyzes its internal runtime behaviors through profiling.\"; Page 8, Section 4.2 (State Abstraction): \"we first apply the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) ... keeps the first k dominant components. For each of the k dimensions, we further partition them into m equal intervals.\"; Page 11, Section 5 (Coverage Criteria): definitions of state- and transition-level criteria including BSCOV and k-SBCOV and transition/input/weighted input coverage (formulas and descriptions) show explicit internal-state and transition-based diagnostic signals; Page 16-17, Section 7.3/7.4 (RQ2 Answer): \"Answer to RQ 2: There is a strong correlation between the state variation (i.e., the Jaccard Index) and erroneous behaviors of the RNN (i.e., WER). The transformed audio is likely to trigger more erroneous behaviors if it covers more different states comparing with the original audio.\"; Page 19, Section 7.5 (RQ4 Answer / Evaluation): empirical results reporting that finer-grained abstractions (higher coverage) produce higher average WER (Fig.8) and Table 3 shows coverage increases with DeepCruiser. These passages demonstrate analysis of model internals and statistical failure patterns but contain no statements attributing discovered failures to deeper causes such as spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting."
