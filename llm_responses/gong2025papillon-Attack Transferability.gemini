  "why": "The paper extensively evaluates the transferability of its generated jailbreak prompts. It includes a specific section (5.4 Attack Transferability) and tables (Table 5 and Table 17) demonstrating that prompts created for a source model can successfully trigger failures in other target models, including different LLMs and even multimodal models (MLLMs). This confirms that fault-inducing inputs are reused to test transferability. However, the paper's methodological description of the PAPILLON framework does not mention any explicit design choices or mechanisms specifically aimed at discovering or enhancing transferable attacks. The design goals of the mutation operators focus on maintaining semantic coherence and shortening prompt length to evade defenses and reduce costs, not on cross-model generalization. Therefore, while transferability is a demonstrated outcome, it is not an explicit goal of the fuzzing design itself.",
  "evidence": "Page 13, Section 5.4 Attack Transferability: \"We further investigate the transferability of PAPILLON. Transferability refers to the extent to which prompts designed to jailbreak the target model can successfully jailbreak another model. ... LLM transferability. We first evaluate transferability by using jailbreak prompts generated by the source model to target another LLM. The results are shown in Table 17 (appendix). ... MLLM transferability. We then assess the transferability of the PAPILLON-generated jailbreak prompts to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). ... The results are presented in Table 5.\"\n\nPage 9, Section 4.2 Template Mutation and Optimization: \"Optimization schemes. When optimizing the jailbreaking templates, we control both semantic coherence and prompt length through system prompt instructions and the hyperparameter of the output length respectively.\" This section details the design goals of the attack generation, which do not include transferability."
