  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate or demonstrate transferability of fault-inducing inputs across models. DeepTest generates synthetic tests and reports erroneous behaviors for three different DNNs, but it treats each model's testing separately and does not (a) reuse inputs crafted on one model to test other models, (b) measure overlap of discovered faults across models, or (c) include design elements explicitly aimed at finding transferable attacks. The authors explicitly contrast their approach with prior differential-testing work (DeepXplore) that used multiple DNNs; DeepTest is presented as a single-model, metamorphic-relation-driven approach rather than a substitute-model transfer-attack methodology.",
  "evidence": "• Paper objective / scope (multiple models tested but separately): “We use DeepTest to systematically test three top performing DNN models from the Udacity driving challenge.” (Abstract / Contributions, p.304). \n\n• Explicit distinction from multi-model differential testing (shows DeepTest is single-model focused): “Pei et al. [70] proposed DeepXplore, a whitebox differential testing algorithm for systematically finding inputs that can trigger inconsistencies between multiple DNNs. … By contrast, our graybox methods use neuron coverage for guided test generation in a single DNN and leverage metamorphic relations to identify erroneous behaviors without requiring multiple DNNs.” (Related Work — Testing and verification of machine learning / DeepXplore comparison, p.312). \n\n• Results present per-model erroneous behaviors but no cross-model reuse/transfer experiments or overlap analysis: e.g., Tables and text report errors per model (Table 8: “Number of unique erroneous behaviors reported by DeepTest for different models...” and surrounding discussion) and aggregate counts, but contain no experiment where inputs found on one model are applied to other models to test transferability (Results / RQ4 and Table 8 discussion, pp.310–311)."
