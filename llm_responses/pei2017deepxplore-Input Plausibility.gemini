  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility through explicit, rule-based, domain-specific constraints designed to generate realistic inputs. For image-based tasks, these constraints simulate plausible environmental conditions like changes in lighting, occlusions from objects, or dirt on a camera lens. For other domains like Android malware, constraints ensure that application functionality is not broken (e.g., only adding permissions, not removing them). The paper provides visual examples (Figure 8) of the generated inputs, which serve as a qualitative validation of their plausibility. However, it does not meet the 'High' criteria because it lacks a formal, empirical validation of the final fault-inducing inputs, such as a human study or quantitative perceptual quality metrics (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM), to confirm their realism. The methodology relies on pre-defined rules rather than ensuring mutations remain within a learned plausible distribution.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section 6.2, \"Domain-specific constraints\": \"As discussed earlier, to be useful in practice, we need to ensure that the generated tests are valid and realistic by applying domain-specific constraints. For example, generated images should be physically producible by a camera... Below we describe two major types of domain-specific constraints (i.e., image and file constraints) that we use in this paper.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 6.2, \"Image constraints (MNIST, ImageNet, and Driving)\": \"DeepXplore used three different types of constraints for simulating different environment conditions of images: (1) lighting effects for simulating different intensities of lights, (2) occlusion by a single small rectangle for simulating an attacker potentially blocking some parts of a camera, and (3) occlusion by multiple tiny black rectangles for simulating effects of dirt on camera lens.\"\n\nPage 11, Figure 8: This figure provides visual examples of the seed inputs and the final difference-inducing inputs generated by DeepXplore under the various constraints (lighting, single occlusion, multiple occlusions), qualitatively demonstrating the plausibility of the outputs."
