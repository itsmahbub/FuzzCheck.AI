  "why": "The paper's fuzzing tool, LipFuzzer, is designed to discover semantic misinterpretations in voice assistant platforms. These failures cause a user's voice command to be incorrectly mapped to an unintended or malicious third-party application (vApp). This is a direct violation of user intent. The paper explicitly details how these failures can lead to undesired and unsafe outcomes, including denial of service (e.g., a garage door command failing), privacy leaks, and phishing attacks. These consequences go beyond simple model robustness errors and constitute unsafe behavior. However, the method does not target or bypass explicit safety or security mechanisms in defended models. Instead, it exploits the inherent fuzzy matching logic and vulnerabilities within the standard Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Intent Classifier components of the voice assistant architecture.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section II-D. Threat Model: \"Attack consequences. We summarize a list of example consequences of interacting with malicous vApps as follows: Denial of Service: This would occur if a device-controlling vApp is hijacked. For example, when a user says “Alexa, close the garage door” to a mismatched malicious vApp instead of a legitimate one, the garage door may be left open. ... Phishing: Third-party vApps’ back-end processing is fully controlled by the developers. ... Audio can thus be manipulated by an attacker at runtime, substituting a benign audio file with a “malicious\" audio file. For example, ... with “Sorry, a critical problem occurred in your Amazon Pay, please answer with your account username and password to know more.”\""
