  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly evaluates transferability: templates (fault-inducing inputs) generated by LLM-FUZZER on a set of surrogate models are reused to test many other models, and the fuzzer's design includes an explicit mechanism (oracle reward modification) to encourage generation of templates that succeed across multiple models. The authors both describe this cross-model generation/evaluation procedure (Experiment III) and report strong transfer results (EASR > 80% on many target models) and comparisons to other methods.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.2 Experiment III (p.4664–4665): \"To address the question of transferability, we chose to create templates using gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, Llama-2-7B-Chat, and Vicuna-7B.... in the template reward assignment by the oracle, a zero reward was imposed if the template’s all successful jailbreak attempts were attributed solely to one or two LLMs.\" \n\nSection 4.2 Experiment III (p.4665): \"Following the exhaustion of the 150k query budget, our experiment involved calculating the average ASR for each template generated across the three target models. The template with the highest average ASR, denoted as 'top-1', and the top five templates with the highest average ASR, known as 'top-5', were selected for further experimentation.\" \n\nSection 4.3 Results for Experiment III (p.4666–4668): \"These templates displayed a notable degree of transferability... As depicted in Figure 4, when evaluated against Vicuna-13B, Baichuan-13B, ChatGLM-6B, Llama-2-13B/70B, Claude1, and PaLM2, the EASR for LLM-FUZZER consistently exceeded 80%, having a huge advantage over EASRs of other methods.\""
