  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility at each mutation step using domain-aware, rule-based mutation functions (e.g., Gaussian noise for images, EDA lexical mutations for text that keep text valid, RDKit-based SMILES enumeration for molecules), and it uses an oracle (norm-balls / L2 radius) to judge whether a perturbed input is an adversarial example. These design choices constrain and preserve naturalness between successive mutations. However, the paper does not describe any mechanism that explicitly prevents or corrects cumulative drift of inputs across many iterative mutations (no global/bounded cumulative perturbation constraint or filtering is specified). Thus plausibility is enforced stepwise but the cumulative-effects across fuzzing iterations are not addressed, matching the Medium level.",
  "evidence": "Page 1191 (Abstract): \"...and the consideration of the naturalness of input perturbation.\" \n\nPage 1197, Section VI.B.1 (Random Mutation): \"When the LSTM input has continuous values (e.g., image input), Gaussian noises with fixed mean and variance are added to the input.\" \n\nPage 1199, Section VII.A.3 (Input Mutation — text): \"To avoid this, we take a set M of mutants from the EDA toolkit [48], which was originally designed to augment the training data for improvement on text classification tasks. This ensures the mutated text paragraphs are always valid. In our experiments, we consider four mutation operations, i.e., M includes synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap, and random deletion. The text meanings are reserved in all mutations.\" \n\nPage 1199, Section VII.A.3 (Input Mutation — SMILES): \"For Lipophilicity model, we take a set M of mutants that change the SMILES string without affecting the molecular structure it represents... The enumerated SMILES strings are the test cases.\" \n\nPage 1197, Algorithm 1 (TESTRNN Algorithm): \"x <- select an element from T; x' <- m(x); T <- T ∪ {x'}; orig[x'] <- orig[x]\" (shows iterative parent->child mutation loop without any global cumulative-perturbation bound or filtering step). \n\nPage 1198, Section VI.C.1 (Test Oracle): \"We define a set of norm-balls, each of which is centered around a data sample with known label... Euclidean distance, i.e., L2-norm ||·||2 is used. A test case x' is said to not pass the oracle if x' is within the norm-ball of some known sample x, i.e., ||x − x'||2 ≤ r_oracle, and if x' has a different classification from x.\""
