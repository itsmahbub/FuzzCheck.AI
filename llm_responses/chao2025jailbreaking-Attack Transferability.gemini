  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper extensively evaluates the transferability of the jailbreak prompts generated by its proposed method, PAIR. Fault-inducing inputs (prompts) generated on source models (GPT-4 and Vicuna) are systematically reused to test their effectiveness on a suite of other target models, with results clearly presented. This fulfills the primary condition for a 'Medium' rating. However, the paper does not meet the criteria for a 'High' rating because the PAIR method's design is not explicitly aimed at discovering transferable attacks. The core algorithm is an iterative refinement process focused on jailbreaking a single, specific target model. The authors attribute the observed high transferability to the semantic nature of the generated prompts, which is a beneficial byproduct of the method rather than an explicit mechanism integrated into the design to optimize for transferability across models.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section IV-B, Jailbreak transfer experiments: \"We next evaluate the transferability of the attacks generated in § IV-A. For PAIR, we use the successful jailbreaks found for GPT-4 and Vicuna... Our results in Table VI indicate that PAIR’s Vicuna prompts transfer more readily than those generated by GCG on all models except GPT-3.5, and PAIR’s GPT-4 prompts transfer well on Vicuna, GPT-3.5, and Gemini. We believe that this is largely attributable to the fact that PAIR’s prompts are semantic, and they therefore target similar vulnerabilities across LLMs, which are generally trained on similar datasets.\" This section, along with Table VI, shows the reuse of prompts to test transferability, but the explanation attributes this property to the semantic nature of the prompts, not to an explicit design choice for promoting transferability."
