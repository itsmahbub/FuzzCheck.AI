  "why": "The paper provides a diagnostic analysis that explains why failures occur by linking them to an underlying model vulnerability. The central thesis is that models fail when presented with inputs from one class that are distributionally very similar to another class. The proposed method, DistXplore, is designed to generate such inputs by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between a test suite of a source class and the training data of a target class. The evaluation in Figure 5 and the surrounding text explicitly demonstrates that as this distributional difference decreases, the model's error rate increases. This analysis directly connects the discovered failures to the model's vulnerability of having a non-robust decision boundary, which is a consequence of the 'distribution shift' between the training data and more varied, potentially ambiguous real-world data. This provides a clear, data-driven explanation for the cause of the failures generated by the tool.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.1.1, Model Evaluation: \"Conversely, if the data distributions between two classes are very similar, the model may struggle to make accurate predictions. Thus, DistXplore aims to generate test cases (in a class) that are statistically similar to the training data in other classes. ... Intuitively, the smaller the value DFf(Sc, c'), the more difficult it is for the model f to distinguish Sc and Tc'. Hence, it is more likely to generate undetectable errors by minimizing their distribution difference.\"\n\nPage 9, Section 4.2.1, Figure 5 and accompanying text: \"The results show that, during the optimization, the distribution of S is getting closer to the training distribution of the target class (see MMD_target) and getting farther away from the source class (see MMD_source). Meanwhile, Error Rate and Error_target Rate are increasing, indicating that more errors are generated and gradually become statistically indistinguishable between the original class c and target class c'.\""
