  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly targets differential testing (DT) and includes a tunable objective function designed to maximize disagreements between a target model and other models (Equation 5). The authors construct surrogate/alternative implementations (quantized 8-bit and 16-bit variants) and generate fault-inducing inputs that cause disagreements between the original model and these other models; they report DT results (Tables 1–4) demonstrating many such cross-model disagreement inputs. Thus BET both (1) reuses/queries inputs across multiple models and (2) incorporates an explicit mechanism (the DT objective term summing differences with other models) to discover transferable failures across model implementations.",
  "evidence": "Page 166, Section 2.2 (Related Work / definition of DT): \"There are two common scenarios for CNN testing, i.e., differential testing (DT) [31, 46] and single model testing (ST) [12, 19]. DT finds error-inducing inputs which trigger behavior inconsistencies among multiple models that have similar functionality ... For example, given two CNN models C1, C2 with similar functionality, an error-inducing input x_err is found if C1(x_err) ≠ C2(x_err).\" \n\nPage 167, Section 3.3 (Tunable objective function for DT): \"Tunable objective function for DT. For DT, we hope to identify inputs that can maximize the prediction difference between the target model with other models.... The tunable objective function for DT is defined in Equation 5. DOF(x) = C(x)[l_i] + Σ_i | C(x)[l_0] - Ĉ_i(x)[l_0] |, ... The second term Σ_i | C(x)[l_0] - Ĉ_i(x)[l_0] | aims to find disagreements between the target model C with a batch of other models Ĉ = {Ĉ_1, Ĉ_2, ...}, as such disagreements indicate error-inducing inputs are found.\" (Equation 5 and surrounding text)\n\nPage 170–171, Section 4.2 (Evaluation: Constructing differential models / Results): \"Constructing differential models. ... We apply these two options to all models and we get corresponding 8-bits and 16-bits quantized models as shown in Table 1. Then, we try to generate error-inducing inputs that cause disagreements between the original model with its quantized models. e.g., generating error-inducing inputs between ResNet50 with ResNet50-q8.\" \n\nPage 171, Section 4.2 (Results): \"Results. Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 show the results of DT on all datasets and models, respectively. Overall, under the same experimental conditions, BET significantly outperforms DiffChaser on all comparison metrics.\" (The presence of these DT-specific evaluation tables shows BET-generated inputs are evaluated across model variants to demonstrate cross-model disagreements.)"
