  "why": "The paper presents TensorFuzz as a system for general-purpose debugging of neural networks by combining coverage-guided fuzzing with property-based testing. The user defines an \"objective function\" that specifies a property the system should not violate. All experiments and examples in the paper demonstrate untargeted exploration for generic failures. The objectives are to find numerical errors (NaNs), any disagreement between a model and its quantized version, bugs in loss functions (e.g., high loss with zero gradient), or inconsistencies between two versions of a code implementation. The method is not designed or evaluated for steering exploration toward a specific, predefined model output (like a chosen class label), but rather for discovering any input that causes a generic fault or violates a general property of correctness or consistency.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section \"TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions\": \"We then compared the predictions of the 32-bit and the 16-bit model on the MNIST test set and found 0 disagreements... With these settings, the fuzzer was able to generate disagreements for 70% of the examples we tried.\" This objective is to find any disagreement, not a specific target classification. \nPage 7, Section \"TensorFuzz can efficiently find numerical errors in trained neural networks\": \"We focus on finding inputs that result in not-a-number (NaN) values.\" This objective targets a generic numerical error, not a specific output. \nPage 8, Section \"TensorFuzz can help make semantics-preserving code transformations\": \"First, we 'attached' TensorFuzz to two copies of the old implementation and wrote an objective function asserting that both implementations are the same.\" This is a form of differential testing to find any inconsistency, which is an untargeted objective."
