  "why": "The paper's method, SENSEI, performs untargeted exploration to discover generic misclassifications. The goal is to improve general robustness against natural perturbations, not to find inputs that cause a specific, attacker-chosen output. The fuzzing process, guided by a genetic algorithm, is designed to find input variants that maximize the model's loss function with respect to the original, correct label. This objective function steers the search towards any input that confuses the model or causes a misclassification, without a predefined target outcome. The paper explicitly distinguishes its focus from targeted adversarial attacks in a security context.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.3.3 Fitness function: \"In SENSEI, we define the fitness function based on the empirical loss of the DNN. More specifically, since the training of DNN focuses on minimizing loss across the entire training data-set, the variant that suffers in more loss by the DNN should be used in the augmented training to make the DNN more robust. Formally: floss(x') = L(θ, x', y)\". This shows the optimization target is maximizing loss relative to the correct label 'y', which is the definition of an untargeted approach.\nPage 4, Section 2.3 Robustness of DNNs: \"Specifically, a DNN M may correctly classify an input x with its corresponding label l, but incorrectly classify an input x + δ that is similar to x, with label l', where l ≠ l'.\" This defines the failure condition as any misclassification (l' is not equal to l), not a specific targeted misclassification."
