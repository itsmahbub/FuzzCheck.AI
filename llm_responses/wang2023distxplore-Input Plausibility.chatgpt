  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility via bounded, rule-based mutation constraints (they adopt conservative mutation bounds and use Lp-norm validity constraints) and additionally reports an explicit human validation of final fault-inducing inputs (manual inspection with high ‘validity ratio’). However, the paper does not report quantitative perceptual metrics (e.g., LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity) nor an explicit analysis of cumulative drift across many fuzzing iterations (it relies on per-mutation constraints and conservative configuration but does not measure or bound accumulated drift over iterations). This matches the 'Medium' level: plausibility of final inputs is validated, and individual mutation steps are constrained, but cumulative-effects across iterations are not explicitly analyzed or controlled.",
  "evidence": "Page 70, Section 2.1.2 (Data Validity): \"In practice, the Lp norm [40] is usually used to guarantee the validity of the generated data by the existing DL testing and adversarial attack techniques. Specifically, given a valid input x, the new test case x' generated by adding some perturbations on x is considered as valid if ||x' - x|| < ε, where ε is a safe radius.\"; Page 72, Section 3.2 (Distribution-Guided Test Generation): \"To guarantee the validity of the generated inputs, we adopt the conservative strategy [63] that constrains the transformation with both 0 and ∞.\"; Page 76, Section 4.2.2 (RQ2: Efficiency of DistXplore): \"In order to evaluate the validity of the generated inputs, we conducted a manual investigation by randomly selecting 10,000 erroneous inputs from the testing outputs of each model and calculating the average validity ratio. The validity ratios were found to be 98.5%+, 96.5%+, 98.7%+, and 95.3%+ for MNIST, Fashion‑MNIST, CIFAR‑10, and SVHN datasets, respectively.\"; (No mention in the paper of perceptual/semantic quantitative metrics such as LPIPS, SSIM, PESQ, STOI or Perplexity, nor of an explicit assessment of cumulative mutation drift across iterations.)"
