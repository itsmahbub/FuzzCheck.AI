  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzer (CureFuzz) is explicitly designed to discover crash-triggering scenarios (broad classes of catastrophic failures such as collisions or falls) by steering exploration via novelty (curiosity), cumulative reward (low reward → higher crash probability), and robustness. It does not define or steer the search toward attacker-chosen, specific target outputs (e.g., a particular label, phrase, or command). Therefore it supports discovery of broader classes of security-violating behaviors rather than targeted, attacker-specified outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 1, Abstract: \"CureFuzz ... aims to reveal a diverse set of crash-triggering scenarios\".\nPage 4, Section 3.1 Assumption: \"CureFuzz is designed to uncover crash-triggering scenarios that eventually lead to the crash of SDMs. It is crucial to note that the definition of a ‘crash’ can vary across different environments... we employ the term ‘crash’ to represent its broader conceptual meaning. Furthermore, our methodology focuses on catastrophic failure rather than minor deviations from optimal performance.\"\nPage 5, Section 3.3 A Curiosity-driven Search Strategy: \"The difference between the outputs of these two networks, referred to as the prediction error, serves as a proxy for the novelty of a given state... This prediction error serves as an intrinsic reward signal for each state. In CureFuzz ... the novelty score of a scenario is the mean of all intrinsic rewards. The intrinsic reward for the ‘novel’ inputs should be higher ... thereby driving the fuzzer to explore those novel states.\"\nPage 6, Section 3.4 CureFuzz Architecture (Seed energy estimation): \"To balance these objectives, the estimation process is based on multiple factors. These factors are intrinsic reward (novelty measure), cumulative reward (probability of triggering crashes), and robustness (probability of triggering unseen states). ... CureFuzz prioritizes the seeds with low cumulative reward. Thus a seed with a lower cumulative reward is accordingly given a higher energy estimation.\"\nPage 8, Section 5 RQ1 (Evaluation): The evaluation and reported metrics focus on \"the total number of detected crash-triggering scenarios, and the distinct types of crash-triggering scenarios,\" demonstrating the method aims to find classes of catastrophic failures rather than produce specific targeted outputs."
