  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper reuses fault-inducing inputs generated by semImFuzz to test multiple different perception models: the same set of 150,000 semantically mutated tests was executed against each of the five SUTs, and the authors report aggregated counts of inconsistencies across SUTs (e.g., \"1210 SUT inconsistencies resulting from 884 mutations\"), which demonstrates reuse of generated failures to evaluate other models. However, the paper does not present design elements or explicit mechanisms aimed at producing or measuring transferable adversarial attacks (e.g., surrogate-model training, cross-model transfer rate analyses, or targeted transferability objectives). The evaluation reports per-SUT inconsistency counts and notes which mutations trigger errors, but it does not characterize transfer rates or describe methods explicitly designed to discover transferable security failures across models. These facts match the metric definition for Medium: inputs are reused to test transferability but the fuzzing design is not explicitly aimed at discovering transferable attacks.",
  "evidence": "Section 6.2 (Tests Generated), p. 1966: \"For evaluation, we ran each SUT on 150,000 tests generated by semImFuzz comprised of 50,000 'Add Car' mutations, 50,000 'Add Person' mutations, and 50,000 'Change Car Color' mutations.\" \n\nSection 6.4.1 (RQ1 Results: Finding Inconsistencies), p. 1966: \"We first remark that semImFuzz found 1210 SUT inconsistencies resulting from 884 mutations and that each SUT had over 100 inconsistencies.\" \n\n(Absence of transfer-focused design) The paper's evaluation and methodology sections (Sections 3, 4, 6) describe mutation design, conformity checks, and per-SUT inconsistency reporting but do not describe surrogate-model-based strategies, explicit cross-model transferability metrics, or procedures to maximize/measure transfer of failures between models. For example, Section 6 (Evaluation) frames results as per-SUT inconsistency counts and severity drops rather than transfer rates or cross-model vulnerability analyses."
