  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight based on observable model internals and statistical failure patterns: it defines and uses 29 neuron features (including activation frequency, layer type and position), analyzes which features/neurons the adaptive strategy favors, and reports correlations between coverage and the variety of adversarial labels. These analyses explain which internal neuron characteristics are associated with effective failure discovery. However, the paper does not directly link discovered failures to higher-level underlying vulnerabilities such as reliance on non-robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting, so it does not meet the 'High' threshold.",
  "evidence": "Page 167, Section 3.1 (Table 1 - Neuron features): \"We designed 29 atomic features that describe characteristics of the neurons... The variable features 18-29 describe the properties of neurons, where these features continuously change over the testing procedure.\"; Page 173, Section 4.4 (Learned Insights): \"Figure 4 shows the changes of the weights of the top-3 (red) and bottom-3 (blue) features... As testing goes by, the solid lines were being skewed toward one direction... the learning algorithm extracts the characteristics of strategies, which increase coverage, well.\"; Page 172, Section 4.3 (Correlation between Coverage and Adversarial Inputs): \"From Figure 1 and Table 3, we can notice that coverage and variety of labels are highly correlated, while coverage and the number of adversarial inputs are not correlated strongly.\""
