  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly acknowledges that cumulative perturbations across fuzzing iterations can lead to semantically invalid or unrealistic inputs. To address this, the proposed method, DeepHunter, incorporates a 'conservative strategy' specifically designed to maintain input plausibility throughout sequential mutations. This is achieved through two key mechanisms: 1) Structural changes via Affine Transformations are restricted to a single application per mutation sequence from an initial seed. 2) Subsequent, less-disruptive Pixel Value Transformations are constrained by computing their cumulative deviation (using L0 and L∞ norms) relative to a stable 'reference image' (which is either the original seed or the image after the single affine transform). This design directly counters the cumulative drift effect by ensuring that all mutations in a sequence remain plausible with respect to a near-original reference, rather than just their immediate parent. The effectiveness of this approach is further validated by a user study, which shows a significantly lower ratio of invalid images compared to other methods.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 3.2.2: \"However, during fuzzing, one image can be sequentially mutated from the initial seed, making it difficult to keep its validity after a sequence of mutations. In order to keep the semantics of the mutants close to the original seed, we adopt a conservative strategy that selects the Affine Transformation to be used only once (we assume that mutation with only one affine transformation will not affect the semantics with the carefully selected parameters) as an image is more likely to be unrecognizable if it is changed by multiple affine transformations. A Pixel Value Transformation can be used multiple times... we use Lo and L∞ to constrain the pixel-level changes.\"\nPage 6, Definition 5: \"The reference image is either the original image (if there is no Affine Transformation) or the generated image after an Affine Transformation. Note that there is only one Affine Transformation during sequential mutations.\" This reference image is used to check the validity of subsequent mutations, thereby controlling cumulative changes."
