  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's method is explicitly designed to find and produce jailbreak prompts that bypass safety/alignment mechanisms in defended models. The authors demonstrate that LLM-FUZZER generates prompts that successfully induce harmful outputs from well-aligned and commercial LLMs (quantified across many models and questions), showing it uncovers high-impact violations of safety/policy safeguards rather than mere low-level robustness errors.",
  "evidence": "Page 4657, Abstract: \"Our experiments show that LLM-FUZZER-generated jailbreak prompts demonstrate significantly increased effectiveness and transferability. This highlights that many open-source and commercial LLMs suffer from severe jailbreak issues, even after safety fine-tuning.\"; Page 4659, Introduction (Section 1): \"...despite dedicated efforts in training set filtering and safety alignment, all existing open-source and commercial LLMs continue to exhibit vulnerabilities to jailbreak prompts.\"; Page 4658, Figure 1 caption: \"In a typical scenario, ChatGPT would reject the harmful question. When this question is embedded within the jailbreak template, the resulting prompt can fool the gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 model into generating a potentially harmful response.\"; Page 4664, Results for Experiment I (Section 4.3): \"Among the 100 unethical questions where human-written templates all failed to jailbreak gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, our fuzzer was capable of generating templates to assist on average 96.85 questions in achieving their jailbreaking objectives through template mutations.\""
