  "why": "The TESTRNN method steers exploration toward satisfying internal coverage conditions (via a genetic \"targeted mutation\" that minimises coverage loss), and its evaluation shows it finds broader security-relevant behaviours (adversarial samples and backdoor-triggered inputs). However, TESTRNN does not aim to induce specific attacker-chosen outputs/labels/phrases: its fitness functions target coverage conditions (internal patterns), and its oracle treats any label change within the norm-ball as an adversarial failure rather than checking for a predefined target output. Therefore the approach supports discovery of broader classes of security-violating behaviours rather than targeted attacks to a specific output.",
  "evidence": "Page 1192, Contributions: \"We implement the proposed coverage metrics into a prototype tool TESTRNN ... which includes two algorithms — a random mutation and a genetic algorithm based targeted mutation — for test case generation. In particular, targeted mutation uses the coverage knowledge to guide the test case generation.\" (Section: Contributions)\n\nPage 1197-1198, Section VI-B (Targeted Mutation / Fitness): \"For the three classes of test conditions (BC, SC, TC) with respect to some s ∈ S and a ∈ A, we define the following fitness function as the distance to their respective targets, e.g., J_BC(x) = α_max − Nm(ξ_{s,a,x,t}), J_SC(x) = α_SC − Nm(Δξ_{s,x,t}), J_TC(x) = sum_{j=1}^w dist(Nz(ˆξ_{s,x,j}), u_j) ... Intuitively, the fitness function (also called coverage loss) J(x) estimates the distance to the satisfaction of an unfulfilled test condition. J(x) ≤ 0 means that the test condition is covered. By generating test cases with the objective of gradually minimizing the loss, the targeted mutation is essentially a greedy search algorithm.\" (Section: Targeted Mutation / Fitness)\n\nPage 1198, Section VI-C1 (Test Oracle): \"A test case x' is said to not pass the oracle if x' is within the norm-ball of some known sample x, i.e., ||x - x'||_2 ≤ r_oracle, and if x' has a different classification from x, i.e., ϕ(x) ≠ ϕ(x'). ... a test case does not pass the oracle is an adversarial sample.\" (Section: Test Oracle)\n\nPage 1201, Section VII-C2 (Detecting Backdoor Input): \"We investigate the possibility of applying coverage-guided testing to the detection of backdoor input in neural networks. ... The experimental results describe that backdoor input activate same internal behavior with clean input for a benign classifier. In contrast to this, the backdoor input to malicious classifier will induce different internal activation, which can be seen from the apparent increase of coverage in T+B.\" (Section: Detecting Backdoor Input)\n\nPage 1192 and Section I / VII (Abstract and Evaluation summary): multiple places state TESTRNN \"can not only find adversarial behaviours for the robustness of RNNs ... but also identify backdoor inputs for the security of RNNs\" (Sections: Abstract / Contributions / VII-C), indicating the tool discovers broader classes of security-violating behaviours rather than targeting specific outputs."
