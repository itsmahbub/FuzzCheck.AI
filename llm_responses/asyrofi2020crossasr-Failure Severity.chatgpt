  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The failures CrossASR is designed to uncover are transcription errors and correctness/accuracy defects (mispredictions) in ASR outputs identified via differential testing between ASRs. The paper demonstrates examples of incorrect transcriptions (e.g., words substituted or mistranscribed) and frames the goal as detecting ASR correctness issues. It does not claim to target or demonstrate uncovering unsafe, biased, hallucinated, or security-critical behaviors, nor does it evaluate bypassing safety/policy or defended/safety-aligned models. Therefore the failures exposed correspond to low-severity (robustness/correctness) errors rather than medium- or high-severity safety/security violations.",
  "evidence": "Page 640, Abstract: \"CrossASR is a differential testing solution that compares outputs of multiple ASR systems to uncover erroneous behaviors among ASRs.\" \n\nPage 641, Introduction / Section II overview: \"CrossASR performs a black-box differential testing to uncover erroneous behaviors on ASR systems by cross-referencing different ASRs to detect different transcriptions from ASRs.\" \n\nPage 642, Section II-A (Case 2): \"In this case, CrossASR considers cases where the transcribed text does not match input text as failed test cases; it considers the other cases as successful test cases.\" \n\nPage 647, Section IV.A (example failed test case): Table IX shows a concrete transcription error: Original Text: \"they can be consulted without difficulty\"; ASR Transcribed Text: \"they can be controlled without difficulty\" (demonstrating a misprediction). \n\nPage 648, Section V.A (related work comparison): \"CrossASR ... is concerned in assessing correctness of ASRs instead of their robustness.\" \n\nPage 643, Experimental setup / Table II: lists the evaluated ASRs (Deepspeech, DeepSpeech2, wav2letter, wit) — the paper does not describe testing of defended, safety-aligned, or policy-protected models nor any experiments demonstrating bypassing of safety or security mechanisms."
