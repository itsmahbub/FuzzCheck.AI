  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper primarily reports discovered failures (counts of failed test cases) and evaluates tool improvements (more failures found when adding ASRs, changing visibility, or using different estimators). While it uses a failure estimator to prioritize texts, it does not analyze model internals (e.g., neuron activations, layer characteristics, coverage metrics) nor provide statistical diagnostic analyses that explain why failures occur (e.g., linking failures to non-robust/spurious features, dataset bias, class-level error concentration, or overfitting). All evidence in the paper concerns numbers of failures and ablation of tool features rather than explanations of underlying model vulnerabilities.",
  "evidence": "Section 2.1 (page 1576): \"At the start of each iteration except the first one, we use failed test cases, successful test cases, and indeterminable test cases so far to train a failure estimator (Line 6). This estimator can estimate the probability of a piece of text leading to a failed test cases.\"  Section 3 RQ1 (page 1577): \"Table 1 illustrates the results of running the tool ... CrossASR++ can find 26.2% more failed test cases than the original tool, which demonstrates significant improvements to the original tool.\"  Section 3 RQ2 / ablation (page 1577): tables and text report how adding ASRs, changing visibility, or switching estimators changes the number of failed test cases (e.g., Table 2 and Table 3), but contain no analysis of model internals or root causes.  Conclusion (page 1578): \"Our evaluation results show that CrossASR++ outperform CrossASR by revealing 26.2% more failed test cases... We also find that leveraging a more advanced failure estimator can help CrossASR++ achieve better performance.\"  Nowhere in the paper are neuron-level signals, coverage metrics, layer/activation analyses, or statistical failure-pattern analyses presented to explain why failures occur."
