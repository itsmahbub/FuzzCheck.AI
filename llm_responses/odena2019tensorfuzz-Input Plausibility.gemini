  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper describes a mutation strategy specifically designed to maintain input plausibility by constraining mutations within an L-infinity norm ball around the original seed image. The authors explicitly state this is done to ensure inputs retain \"unambiguous class semantics\" and to avoid testing on \"out-of-domain garbage data\". This method enforces plausibility by bounding the cumulative perturbation from the original seed. However, the paper does not provide any empirical validation, such as a human study or quantitative perceptual quality metrics (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM), to systematically assess whether the final fault-inducing inputs are indeed realistic. It only provides a single visual example (Figure 3). This meets the criteria for \"Medium\" as it enforces plausibility through bounded constraints but does not include an explicit assessment of the final inputs' plausibility.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 6, \"TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions\": \"We then ran the fuzzer with mutations restricted to lie in a radius 0.4 infinity norm ball surrounding the seed images, using the activations of only the 32-bit model as coverage. We restrict to inputs near seed images because these inputs nearly all have unambiguous class semantics. It is less interesting if two versions of the model disagree on out-of-domain garbage data with no true class.\"\n\nPage 5, Section 5, \"Mutator\": \"The second is to add white noise, but to constrain the difference between the mutated element and the original element from which it is descended to have a user-configurable L∞ norm. This type of constrained mutation can be useful if we want to find inputs that satisfy some objective function, but are still plausibly of the same 'class' as the original input that was used as a seed.\""
