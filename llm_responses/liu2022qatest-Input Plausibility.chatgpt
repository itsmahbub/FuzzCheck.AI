  "why": "QATest applies per-step plausibility checks (ROUGE-1 similarity to the immediate parent) and an authenticity-guiding criterion (perplexity priority on POS abstract sequences) to reduce implausible mutations. These mechanisms enforce plausibility between successive mutation steps and attempt to mitigate drift over iterations. However, the paper does not enforce a strict global constraint that guarantees mutated inputs remain within a single plausible input distribution across many iterative mutations (it relies on per-step ROUGE checks, selection heuristics, and perplexity-based prioritization rather than an explicit, iteration-spanning distribution constraint). Therefore the design controls local plausibility but does not fully guarantee prevention of cumulative drift across many iterations.",
  "evidence": "Algorithm 1 and Quality Assessment (Section 3.1 / 3.2.5): \"quality_score ← Rouge1(s, s'); if quality_score > τ then // acceptable D.append(s')\" — QATest discards generated questions that fall below a ROUGE-1 threshold, i.e., enforces similarity to the immediate parent. (Algorithm 1 / Section 3.2.5, paper) \n\nPerplexity mitigation of iteration drift (Section 3.3.2): \"Since QATest samples seed data and applies transformations to generate questions in each iteration, the authenticity of the generated questions may decrease as the iteration batch increases. To ensure that the generated test questions have good authenticity and rationality, we consider applying perplexity priority as guidance for seed data retention.\" and \"In each iteration, QATest selects the generated question with the lowest perplexity score in a generated batch.\" (Section 3.3.2 Perplexity Priority, paper) \n\nDesign acknowledgement but absence of an explicit global plausibility constraint (Discussion / Effectiveness, Section 6.2): \"the perplexity priority can assist in ensuring the authenticity of the seed set and maintaining the real meaning of the generated questions after iterative transformations.\" This indicates mitigation but not a formal guarantee that cumulative drift cannot produce unrealistic inputs. (Section 6.2, paper)"
