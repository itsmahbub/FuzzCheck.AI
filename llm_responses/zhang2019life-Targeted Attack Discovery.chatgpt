  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's LipFuzzer is explicitly designed to steer exploration toward discovering security-relevant classes of misinterpretation (e.g., vApp squatting, hijacking, privacy/phishing consequences) by generating and verifying LAPSUS variants of seed voice-command templates. However, the method does not aim to produce a specific, attacker-chosen model output (e.g., force the classifier to emit one predefined intent/phrase); instead it searches for inputs that cause unintended/vulnerable behaviors (any incorrect invocation or installation). Thus it targets broader classes of security-violating behaviors rather than specific predetermined outputs, matching the 'Medium' level.",
  "evidence": "Intro / Page 2: \"Our tool generates potential voice commands that are likely to incur a semantic inconsistency such that a user reaches an unintended vApp/functionality (i.e. users think they use voice commands correctly but yield unwanted results).\" (Section I, Our Approach paragraph).; Template Fuzzing / Verification / Page 8: \"We verify if a LAPSUS is effective by testing the synthesis audio with Alexa. ... We define that a LAPSUS is verified to be effective when it is incorrectly interpreted by the VA system. For example, if the vApp is not installed after an installation-related LAPSUS is played to VA devices, then this LAPSUS is effective.\" (Section IV-C, Verification).; Threat & Goals / Page 2–3: The paper frames consequences as classes of security violations (Denial of Service, Privacy Leakage, Phishing) caused by misinterpretation and states evaluation goals such as: \"(i) We empirically verify that the problematic Intent Classifier can lead to speech misinterpretation related to LAPSUS.\" (Section VI, Evaluation goals)."
