  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate or demonstrate transferability of fault-inducing inputs across different models. DLFuzz is explicitly designed to avoid cross-referencing multiple models (unlike DeepXplore) and treats an input as a fault when the mutated input and the original input produce different labels on the same CNN under test. The evaluation compares DLFuzz to DeepXplore on per-model metrics (neuron coverage, number of adversarial inputs, perturbation size, time) but does not reuse adversarial inputs generated on one model to test other models or report whether such inputs trigger failures across models. The only related experiment (augmenting training sets) retrains the same CNNs with adversarial images and is not a transferability test. Therefore the paper does not demonstrate transferable attacks nor include mechanisms explicitly aimed at discovering transferable failures across models.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.739, Abstract): \"DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other DL systems with the same functionality.\" \n\nSection 3.1 Architecture (p.740, 3.1 Architecture): \"If the mutated input t' and the original input t are both fed to the CNN but classified to be of different class labels, we treat this as an incorrect behavior and t' to be one of the adversarial inputs.\" \n\nIntroduction / Evaluation summary (p.740, end of Intro / start of 3): \"Compared with DeepXplore, DLFuzz does not need extra efforts to collect similar functional DL systems for cross-referencing label check...\" \n\nResults (p.742, 4.2 Result): \"we incorporated 114 adversarial images into the training set of three CNNs on MNIST and retrained them trying to increase their accuracy.\" (This describes retraining with generated adversarial inputs, not testing those inputs on other, unseen models.)"
