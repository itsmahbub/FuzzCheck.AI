  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's method, CrossASR, generates audio test cases using Text-To-Speech (TTS) engines. This design choice inherently aims for plausible inputs, as TTS systems are specifically created to produce realistic, human-like speech. More importantly, the paper provides direct empirical evidence for the plausibility of the fault-inducing inputs through a human evaluation. The authors tasked a native English speaker with verifying a statistically significant sample of the generated failed test cases. The explicit goal was to check if the audio was understandable to a human. The results confirmed that the vast majority of inputs that caused failures were indeed plausible and intelligible. This combination of a generation method designed for plausibility (TTS) and a rigorous human-centric validation of the final, failure-inducing inputs satisfies the criteria for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section VI, Conclusion: \"CrossASR is highly reliable in determining failed test cases, as demonstrated by manual verification. Almost all of the failed test case samples inspected are actual failed test cases (audio understandable to humans but cannot be transcribed properly by an ASR).\"\n\nPage 5, Section III-C, RQ4: \"To measure the reliability of CrossASR in determining failed test cases, we ask a native English speaker, who is not an author of this paper to verify whether the failed test cases generated by CrossASR are actual failed test cases.\"\n\nPage 6, Section III-D, RQ4: \"The non-author verified that in the random sample, CrossASR generates failed test cases with the highest and lowest FPR of 9% and 0%, respectively. From all combination of TTSes and ASRs, the FPRs are low, which means that the failed test cases that are detected by CrossASR actually highlight a deficiency in the corresponding ASR (it is a true positive).\""
