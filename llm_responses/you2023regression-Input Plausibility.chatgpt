  "why": "The paper explicitly incorporates multiple mechanisms to enforce input plausibility throughout fuzzing iterations and provides empirical human-evaluation evidence that the final fault-inducing inputs remain perceptually/semantically realistic. Concretely, DRFuzz: (1) constrains mutations (pixel-level mutations limited to 0.5% of pixels and image-level mutations applied to whole images to avoid unrealistic partial edits); (2) uses a GAN discriminator (trained on the original training set) to compute a per-seed fidelity threshold and filter out low-fidelity mutated inputs during the fuzzing process; and (3) limits cumulative drift via seed-generation controls (e.g., max_times to bound number of times a seed can be mutated and an exponential-decay seed selection probability) and tree-based trimming. The authors also report a manual/human evaluation comparing DRFuzz (with GAN filtering) to a variant without the GAN: two authors labeled sampled inputs (Cohen’s kappa = 0.67), finding 86% of DRFuzz inputs labeled high-fidelity vs 57.5% for the no-GAN variant. These elements together satisfy the metric requirement of enforcing plausibility through iterations and providing empirical (human) evidence for plausibility of final fault-inducing inputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 84, Section III-B (GAN-based Fidelity Assurance): \"During the fuzzing process, we feed an initial seed into the Discriminator to get a fidelity score, which serves as the fidelity threshold for filtering out the low-fidelity inputs generated from this initial seed.\"; Page 86, Table I / Section III-C (Mutation Rules): \"Pixel-Level Mutation aims to change a small set of pixels in an image ... DRFuzz randomly selects a small set of pixels (i.e., 0.5% total pixels) for mutation.\" and \"Image-Level Mutation ... this category of mutation rules can simulate real-world scenarios more effectively when applying them to the whole image.\"; Page 88, Section IV-A5 (Implementations and Experiments): \"... we set ... max_times to be 10 ...\" (bounding number of times a seed can be mutated); Page 90, Section IV-B2 (Contribution of the main component of DRFuzz): \"Specifically, we sample 100 inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG and DRFuzz, respectively, and two authors manually evaluate their fidelity individually. The Cohen’s Kappa coefficient between their evaluation is 0.67. They label 86% of inputs generated by DRFuzz as high-fidelity and only 57.5% of inputs generated by DRFuzz_NG as high-fidelity.\""
