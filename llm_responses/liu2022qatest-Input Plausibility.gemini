  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process using two distinct, explicit mechanisms. First, after each mutation, a quality assessment is performed using the ROUGE-1 metric to measure the similarity between the original and transformed question. Generated questions that fall below a certain similarity threshold are discarded, ensuring that individual mutation steps do not drastically alter the input's semantic meaning. Second, to address the cumulative effect of mutations across iterations, the framework uses a 'perplexity priority' criterion to guide the selection of new seeds. This mechanism prioritizes generated questions that are more linguistically fluent and authentic (i.e., have lower perplexity) to be added back into the seed pool for further fuzzing. The combination of ROUGE-based filtering and perplexity-guided seed selection ensures that the generated inputs remain within a plausible distribution throughout the process. These quantitative, task-specific measures (ROUGE for similarity, perplexity for fluency) serve as the empirical evidence that the framework maintains realistic inputs, as required by the metric definition.",
  "evidence": "1. Page 5, Section 3.2.5, Quality Assessment: \"To ensure the quality of generated questions, we employ the ROUGE-1 metric [35] to evaluate the questions generated by metamorphic transformations.\" \n2. Page 4, Algorithm 1: The algorithm shows that generated questions are only kept if their ROUGE score is above a threshold: \"if quality_score > τ then // acceptable D.append(s');\"\n3. Page 6, Section 3.3.2, Perplexity Priority: \"To ensure that the generated test questions have good authenticity and rationality, we consider applying perplexity priority as guidance for seed data retention.\"\n4. Page 7, Definition 3.5 (Perplexity priority): The framework selects the question with the lowest perplexity to feed back into the seed set: \"s** = arg min per(q) q∈G\""
