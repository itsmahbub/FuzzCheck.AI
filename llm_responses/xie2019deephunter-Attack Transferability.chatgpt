  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper explicitly defines and implements a mechanism to detect faults that transfer from an original model to other models (specifically quantized versions), and the evaluation reuses tests generated on the original (unquantized) model to detect errors in the quantized models. Definition 3 formalizes a “quantization erroneous behavior” (i.e., a fault that manifests in one model but not the other), DeepHunter’s workflow and experiments use that relation, and RQ4 reports results where tests generated on the original model are applied to quantized variants to measure such transfer. This demonstrates both reuse of fault-inducing inputs across models performing the same task (original vs. quantized) and an explicit design for discovering transferable failures.",
  "evidence": "Page 149, Section 3.2.1 (Transformation and Mutation) — Definition 3: \"Given a DNN F and its quantized version F', a human oracle O, a metamorphic mutation strategy M and a test x satisfying F(x) = O(x) ∧ F'(x) = O(x), a mutant x' ∈ M(x) is a quantization erroneous behavior between F and F' if (F(x) = F(x') ∨ F'(x) = F'(x')) ∧ F(x') ≠ F(x).\" \n\nPage 154, Section 5.4 (RQ4. Error Detection for Quantization) — experimental procedure and results: \"In this experiment, all initial seeds of each dataset are unable to detect the errors before and after quantization for all cases... At runtime, we allocate 10 hours for test generation on each original unquantized model... Table 6 summarizes the results in detecting errors introduced during quantization by DeepHunter+Prob and TensorFuzz.\" \n\nPage 154, Section 5.4 (Answer to RQ4): \"With corner-region based criteria, DeepHunter tends to be more useful for detecting errors introduced during the DNN quantization. A larger QR often introduces larger decision logic inconsistencies before and after quantization.\""
