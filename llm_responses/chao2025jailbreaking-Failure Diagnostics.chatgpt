  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight through statistical analyses and ablations that characterize where and when PAIR succeeds or fails (e.g., per-model and per-category jailbreak rates, transferability matrices, defended performance, and attacker-design ablations). It connects some failure patterns to broader sources of vulnerability (for example, noting PAIR's difficulty with heavily safety fine-tuned models and attributing transferability to shared training data), but it does not analyze observable model internals (no neuron, layer, coverage, or activation analyses) nor provide deeper mechanistic explanations (e.g., reliance on specific non-robust features, spurious cues, or overfitting at the neuron/layer level). This matches the metric's “Medium” level: statistical/failure-pattern and ablation diagnostics are present, but internal-model diagnostic analyses are absent.",
  "evidence": "Section IV-A (Direct jailbreaking attacks), p.27: \"However, PAIR struggles with Llama-2 and the Claude models, demonstrating the success of the extensive safety fine-tuning.\" (Section IV-A paragraph discussing Table III) \n\nSection IV-B (Jailbreak transfer experiments), p.28: \"We believe that this is largely attributable to the fact that PAIR’s prompts are semantic, and they therefore target similar vulnerabilities across LLMs, which are generally trained on similar datasets.\" (explaining transferability results in Table VI) \n\nFigure 4 caption / Section IV (Categorization), p.29: \"Categorizing PAIR’s jailbreak %. Each square represents PAIR’s JB% for a target LLM (x-axis) and JBB-Behaviors category (y-axis); darker squares indicate higher JB%.\" (shows per-category statistical failure patterns across models) \n\nSection IV-C / Table VIII (Defended performance), p.29: \"the JB% of PAIR drops significantly less than GCG when defended by these two defenses, meaning that PAIR is significantly harder to defend against than GCG.\" (statistical comparison under defenses) \n\nSection IV-E (Ablation experiments), p.30: \"We find that jailbreaks are most likely to be found in the first or second query, and observe diminishing returns as the depth increases.\" and \"We find that across the board, the role-playing approach is most effective, given that it finds 82 out of the 88 successful jailbreaks for Vicuna.\" (statistical/ablation analysis of attack design choices)\n\nWhat is not present (negative evidence): Nowhere in the design, implementation, or evaluation sections (III, IV, Appendices) does the paper present analyses of internal model signals such as neuron activation frequency, layer-wise behavior, model coverage metrics, or per-neuron correlations with failures; nor does it provide mechanistic attribution to specific non-robust/spurious features at the internal-activation level (no neuron/layer quotes or tables)."
