  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility through rule-based constraints on its mutation operators, which it terms \"metamorphic transformations.\" The stated goal is to generate audio that \"sounds normal to human.\" Plausibility is enforced in two ways: 1) by carefully selecting parameters for individual transformations to ensure they do not perceptibly alter the audio, and 2) by explicitly limiting the cumulative effect of transformations related to volume, speed, or clearness to a single application per seed audio. This second constraint is a direct attempt to prevent the cumulative drift that can lead to unrealistic inputs. However, the paper falls short of the 'High' rating because it does not provide any empirical validation (e.g., a human study or quantitative metrics like PESQ/STOI) to confirm that the final, fault-inducing audio inputs are, in fact, plausible and intelligible. The claims of realism are based on the design of the transformation strategy rather than on an evaluation of its outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 14, Section 6.1: \"transformations for generating defect candidates indistinguishable to human before and after the transformations: (1) we carefully set the parameters to ensure that a single step transformation (on volume, speed or clearness) does not violate the metamorphic relations (i.e., human hearing are not affected); and (2) an audio, generated by mutating from a seed after a sequence of transformations T, is limited to be mutated by a transformation t ∈ S U UAT such that ({t} U S) ∩ T = ∅, where S ∈ {VR, SRT, CRT}. Intuitively, the constraints make sure that a mutant is generated by altering the volume, speed or clearness of a seed input at most once.\""
