  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not evaluate or demonstrate attack transferability. While CrossASR++ feeds each synthesized audio to multiple ASR systems simultaneously (so generated inputs are executed on several models), the authors do not (a) craft fault-inducing inputs on a surrogate model and then reuse them to test other models, nor (b) analyze whether fault-inducing inputs discovered for one model also trigger failures in other models. The experiments focus on (i) fine-tuning the SUT with generated test cases to reduce its failures, and (ii) fine-tuning one cross-referenced ASR to improve CrossASR++’s ability to find failures. These evaluations measure improvement in detection and model quality, not the transferability of faults between independently-trained target models.",
  "evidence": "Page 675, Section II.A: \"The generated audio file is then fed to all ASR systems inside CrossASR++ (SUT and ASR1 to ASRm in Fig. 1). The tool cross-references the outputs of these ASR systems and tags the synthesized audio-text pair as a valid test case if at least one of the ASR systems can successfully transcribe the audio.\" \n\nPage 677, Section III.C (RQ2 - Experiment Design & Result): \"In this research question, we want to investigate whether fine-tuning one of the cross-referenced ASR systems using generated test cases can boost the performance of CrossASR++ to uncover failed test cases... For the evolved CrossASR++, we continuously evolve DeepSpeech and always utilize DeepSpeech as one of the ASR systems used for cross-referencing... By comparing the number of failed test cases found by the static and evolved CrossASR++ head-to-head, it is clear that the evolved CrossASR++ uncovers more failed test cases than the static one for each ASR system.\" \n\n(These excerpts show that inputs are evaluated across multiple ASRs and that the paper measures improvements from fine-tuning, but there is no experiment or analysis that shows fault-inducing inputs crafted on one (surrogate) model transfer to other models.)"
