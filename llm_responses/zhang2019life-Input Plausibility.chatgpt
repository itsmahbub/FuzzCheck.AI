  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility throughout its fuzzing design and provides empirical human-driven evidence that the fault-inducing inputs remain realistic. LipFuzzer mutates NLP-preprocessed templates using linguistically-grounded LAPSUS Models (Bayesian Networks) constructed from curated linguistic knowledge and further weight-trained with audio recordings from a user study. The fuzzer applies a probability cutoff to filter low-likelihood mutations and explicitly limits mutations per seed (\"we only get one mutation for each voice command\"), reducing cumulative drift. Finally, generated inputs are converted to speech (TTS) and verified on real VA devices; the authors report human-collected/resynthesized examples and measured rates (e.g., 77% of synthesized transcriptions still induced semantic inconsistency), demonstrating that many fault-triggering inputs are perceptually/semantically plausible.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, (Introduction / Our Approach): \"we design LipFuzzer’s basic template fuzzing by first mutating NLP pre-processed voice command templates. Then, we input mutated voice commands to VA devices by using machine speech synthesis to eliminate the human factor of producing ASR-related misinterpretation.\"; Page 7, (IV.B Weight Training): \"Weight Training. After we have the initial BN ... we further train the weight ... through a user study with audio recording.\"; Page 8, (IV.C Verification / Template Fuzzing): \"Verification. We verify if a LAPSUS is effective by testing the synthesis audio with Alexa. To do that, we first synthesize speech from generated LAPSUS voice commands.\"; Page 11, (VI-B Cutoffs for Different Query Strategies): \"Note that, during the fuzzing, we only get one mutation for each voice command.\"; Page 11, (VI-A Intent Classifier Evaluation): \"Our result shows that 77% (84/109) still incur the semantic inconsistency, which means LAPSUS still exists.\"; Page 11, (VI-B The Cutoff Value): \"By applying this cutoff value, we cut off 49.9% of generated LAPSUS population with the effectiveness rate increased to 59.52%.\""
