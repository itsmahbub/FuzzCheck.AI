  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's TESTRNN method explicitly uncovers undesired and security-relevant behaviors (adversarial mispredictions and backdoor-triggered misclassifications) — i.e., failures that violate user intent or safety expectations. However, the paper does not demonstrate bypassing explicit safety/policy/security mechanisms in defended or safety-aligned models (for example, adversarially-trained or otherwise defended models), nor does it claim to induce jailbreaks, data leakage, or unauthorized actions in defended systems. Thus the failures uncovered are higher than mere low-level robustness errors but do not meet the paper-evidence threshold for the highest severity class that requires bypassing explicit defenses.",
  "evidence": "Page 1191 (Abstract / Introduction): \"In this article, we study the RNN defects, focusing on adversarial samples [1] and backdoor samples [10].\"\n\nPage 1192 (Contributions): \"TESTRNN can not only find adversarial behaviors for the robustness of RNNs (see Section VII-C1) but also identify backdoor inputs for the security of RNNs (see Section VII-C2).\"\n\nPage 1200 (Section VII-A / Experimental Setup): \"We train two handwritten digits recognition models, one of which is benign classifier and the other one is the malicious classifier subject to the backdoor attack in [17].\"\n\nPage 1201 (Section VII-C2, sensitivity / conclusion): \"Answer to RQ4: The TESTRNN metrics can identify the difference between the backdoor input and the normal input (to malicious models).\"\n\nPage 1201 (Section VII-C2, limitation noted): \"We remark that the aforementioned experiment only confirms that test metrics are sensitive to backdoor samples when testing an attacked model.\""
