  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper performs mutations on in-memory numeric environment states (positions, angles, speeds, ground types) and evaluates crashes by executing the mutated states in the simulator, but it does not describe any handling of standard I/O/serialization effects (rounding, quantization, clipping) nor constraining perturbations to survive serialization. For CARLA the SDM consumes RGB images, yet CureFuzz mutates underlying world-state floats (positions/angles) and uses the simulator to render and evaluate states without any explicit discussion of ensuring that the fault-inducing perturbations persist under serialization (e.g., 8-bit image quantization) or of generating inputs directly in serialized formats. Therefore failures discovered could be fragile numeric artifacts that would not persist after standard I/O operations, and the paper does not explicitly account for serialization effects during mutation or oracle evaluation.",
  "evidence": "Page 6, Section 4.2.1 (Autonomous Driving): \"In the CARLA simulator, at each timestep, the SDM receives an RGB image and its current velocity as inputs.\" \n\nPage 6, Section 4.2.1 (Autonomous Driving): \"When CureFuzz mutates a given state, small perturbations are randomly generated and added to the positions and angles of these vehicles. We use the CARLA simulator itself to check for the validity of the mutated state. All illegally mutated states and the states that trigger initial collision are discarded in our experiments.\" \n\nPage 5, Section 3.4 (Seed Mutation): \"Once a seed is selected from the corpus, the SeedMutation function generates a new mutated state by applying a small random perturbation to a selected state. The mutated state is fed into the EnvMonitor function to generate its corresponding state sequence and collect the cumulative reward. We need to ensure that the mutated seed lies in the legitimate state spaces, and the mutated seed would not trigger an initial crash. In our experiments, we have carefully addressed this concern and verified the validity of each mutated seed, details are given in Section 4.\" \n\nPage 7, Section 4.3 (Implementation): \"When mutating a seed, the magnitude of the random perturbation is a critical factor that can impact the performance of the fuzzer. We re-use the code implementation from Pang et al. for generating mutations.\" \n\n(Note: the paper contains no statements about handling serialization, quantization, rounding, clipping, or about generating inputs directly in serialized formats such as saved images/audio/text to ensure reproducibility under standard I/O.)"
