  "why": "The paper's method, CrossASR, is based on differential testing, not attack transferability. It generates a single audio input and feeds it to multiple Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems simultaneously. A failure is defined based on a disagreement among the outputs of these systems. Specifically, a test case is considered a failure for a particular ASR if its transcription does not match the input text, while at least one other ASR's transcription does. The methodology does not involve generating a fault-inducing input on a single source/surrogate model and then reusing that specific input to test for failures on other target models. The evaluation counts the total number of failures detected for each ASR system individually but does not analyze or report on whether the same audio inputs caused failures across multiple ASRs. Therefore, it does not demonstrate the transferability of fault-inducing inputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section II-A, Architecture, Case 2: \"At least one of the ASR transcribed texts that matches with the input Text while at least one of the other ASR Transcribed Texts do not match with the input Text. In this case, CrossASR considers cases where the transcribed text does not match input text as failed test cases...\" This describes the core differential testing mechanism, where a failure in one model is identified by its disagreement with a successful transcription from another model for the same input, rather than testing for transferability of a known failing input. \n\nPage 6, Table V, \"NUMBER OF FAILED TEST CASES GENERATED FOR EACH COMBINATION OF TTSES AND ASRS\": This table presents the total number of failures for each ASR model as separate, aggregated counts. For example, using the Google TTS, it found 4,036 failures for Deepspeech and 2,539 for Deepspeech2. The paper does not analyze the intersection of these sets to determine how many specific audio files caused failures in both models."
