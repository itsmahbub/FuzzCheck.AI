  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's method, Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), is explicitly designed to generate 'semantic, human-interpretable prompts'. The core mechanism uses an attacker LLM to craft and iteratively refine prompts based on high-level, semantic strategies such as role-playing, logical appeal, and authority endorsement. This generative process inherently ensures that the inputs (prompts) produced at every iteration are plausible, coherent, and reside within the distribution of natural language. The paper consistently contrasts this approach with 'token-level' jailbreaks, which it characterizes as uninterpretable and analogous to the unrealistic inputs the metric describes. By design, PAIR's mutations are semantic rewrites, preventing the cumulative drift into semantically invalid or unrealistic inputs that is a concern in other domains.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Section II. PRELIMINARIES, 'We focus on prompt-level jailbreaks, wherein the goal is to craft semantic, human-interpretable prompts that fool a targeted LLM into outputting objectionable content.' Further evidence is on the same page in Figure 2, which explicitly compares an uninterpretable 'Token-Level Jailbreak' generated by GCG with a semantically valid and plausible 'Prompt-Level Jailbreak' generated by PAIR."
