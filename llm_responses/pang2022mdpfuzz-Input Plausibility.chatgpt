  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility during fuzzing by (1) restricting mutations to the MDP initial state rather than arbitrary intermediate states, (2) applying only small/bounded random perturbations, and (3) validating every mutated initial state using environment validation modules and scenario-specific bounds (e.g., speed limits). These design choices ensure mutated inputs remain realistic at each mutation step. However, the paper does not provide an explicit human evaluation or task-specific perceptual/semantic quality metrics (e.g., LPIPS/SSIM, PESQ/STOI, Perplexity) to empirically quantify the perceptual/semantic realism of the final crash-inducing inputs. Nor does it present quantitative perceptual measures for the final fault-inducing inputs; instead it reports internal neuron-activation differences and detection AUCs. Therefore the work fits the \"Medium\" level: plausibility is enforced in mutation/validation steps, but formal empirical perceptual assessments of final fault-inducing inputs are not reported.",
  "evidence": "Introduction (p. 378): \"Second, instead of mutating arbitrary intermediate states, MDPFuzz only mutates the initial state conservatively to ensure that the sequence is realistic. The mutated initial states are also validated in a deliberate way to ensure realism.\"; Section 6, 'MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation' (p. 385): \"When sampling, the initial states are randomly selected from the state space P. MDPFuzz randomly mutates initial states with small noise. All the mutated states are validated in an automated and deliberate way (see below). That is, we confirm that all mutated initial states are valid and solvable.\"; Section 5 (Assumptions / Alg.1 description) (pp. 382–383): \"We clarify that this assumption is realistic... MDPFuzz only mutates the initial state S0 of an MDP, under the constraint that it is still realistic and solvable after mutation. See Sec. 6 on how mutated initial states are validated in this study.\"; RQ3 Results (p. 387): \"we emphasize that the crashes found by MDPFuzz are not due to unrealistic states. Rather, they share similar visual appearances with normal states and can occur in real-world scenarios.\"; (Counter-evidence / absence) No sections report human studies or quantitative perceptual/linguistic quality metrics (e.g., LPIPS/SSIM, PESQ/STOI, Perplexity) for final fault-inducing inputs—the evaluation focuses on neuron-activation patterns (t-SNE) and detection AUC (Section 7.3–7.4)."
