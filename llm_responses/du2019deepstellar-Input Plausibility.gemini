  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's coverage-guided testing (CGT) method is designed with input plausibility in mind. It explicitly states the use of a \"metamorphic mutation strategy... that would keep the prediction meaning from the human's perspective during testing.\" The transformations used for generating perturbed inputs are standard, bounded operations (e.g., image contrast, brightness, rotation), which enforce plausibility within individual mutation steps. The paper also claims that the perturbations are \"slight and imperceptible\" and that adversarial samples are \"not perceptible by human.\" \n\nHowever, the evaluation does not meet the criteria for 'High'. Firstly, the paper does not discuss or provide a mechanism to control for the cumulative effect of mutations over many iterations, which could cause inputs to drift from the plausible distribution. Secondly, the claim of imperceptibility is not substantiated with empirical evidence, such as a human study or quantitative, task-specific metrics (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM, PESQ). This approach aligns with the 'Medium' definition, as it enforces plausibility in individual mutation steps via bounded constraints but does not address cumulative effects or provide rigorous empirical validation of the final outputs' realism.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 5.2: \"For CGT, we mainly focus on image classification and apply the metamorphic mutation strategy [55] for generating new mutants that would keep the prediction meaning from the human's perspective during testing.\"\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, Data Preparation: \"For each MNIST model, we also generate 10,000 benign perturbed samples with existing image transformation techniques [50] (i.e., image contrast, brightness, translation, scaling, shearing, rotation and add white noise).\"\n\nPage 8, Section 6.1, Data Preparation: \"For both audio and image case, we set conservative parameters for transformation so that the perturbation on original samples is slight and imperceptible. Note that all the adversarial samples are also with minimal perturbations and not perceptible by human.\""
