  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by measuring and analyzing observable model internals (multiple neuron-level coverage metrics) and by statistically characterizing failure counts and diversity under different coverage criteria and seed-selection strategies. It uses these signals to compare which criteria and strategies expose more errors (including a targeted analysis showing corner-region criteria like NBC/SNAC/TKNC are better at revealing quantization-induced inconsistencies). However, the paper does not provide deeper root-cause explanations that link failures to broader underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on spurious / non-robust features, dataset bias, or overfitting, so it does not meet the 'High' level.",
  "evidence": "Page 148, Section 2 (DNN Testing Criteria): \"DNN Testing Criteria. ... we perform a large-scale controlled study on the following testing criteria [31, 36]. • Neuron Coverage (NC). ... • k-Multisection Neuron Coverage (KMNC). ... • Neuron Boundary Coverage (NBC). ... • Strong Neuron Activation Coverage (SNAC). ... • Top-k Neuron Coverage (TKNC).\" \n\nPage 149, Section 3.3 (Extensible Testing Criteria): \"we implement 5 existing criteria [31, 36] as different feedback metrics to determine whether the newly generated tests should be kept for further mutation. The criteria represent the state-of-the-arts and have been proven to be useful to capture the internal DNN states.\" \n\nPage 153, Section 5.3 (RQ3 Results of Error Detection): \"We also observe that KMNC is less effective than the other criteria in detecting errors, likely because it mainly considers the major functional behavior coverage [31].\" (discussion linking observed error-detection performance to properties of coverage metrics)\n\nPage 154, Section 5.4 (RQ4 Error Detection for Quantization): \"We can see that the number of errors found by DeepHunter with different coverage guidance is different. With NBC, DeepHunter found more errors for LeNet-5 and ResNet-20. ... The result reveals that KMNC and NC, which represent the overall major behavior of DNNs, are relatively not effective in such scenarios. Corner-region based criteria may be more useful to capture quantization errors.\""
