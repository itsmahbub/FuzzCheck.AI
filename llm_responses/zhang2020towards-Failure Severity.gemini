  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper proposes a method, implemented as a tool named KuK, to generate \"uncommon\" input data (adversarial examples) based on uncertainty metrics. A key part of the paper's evaluation is to test whether this generated uncommon data can bypass explicit, state-of-the-art defense mechanisms designed to protect models against adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that the generated inputs successfully evade a suite of defense techniques—including mutation-based detection, defensive distillation, feature squeezing, and binary classifiers—with significantly higher success rates compared to common adversarial examples. This directly aligns with the 'High' severity rating, which requires uncovering failures by bypassing explicit safety or security mechanisms in defended models.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section 5.2, \"RQ4: Evaluation on Defense Techniques\": \"To demonstrate the usefulness of the generated uncommon data in Table 5, this experiment intends to study whether the data can bypass the existing defense techniques. Setting. Since different defense techniques are proposed on different subject datasets, we selected popular techniques based on the datasets. For MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset, we selected the following defense techniques: binary activation classifier [13], mutation-based adversarial attack detection [53], defensive distillation [40], label smoothing [17], and feature squeezing [57]. For ImageNet, we selected the mutation-based adversarial attack detection [53], input transformations [15] and pixel deflection [43].\" \n\nPage 11, \"Answer to RQ4\": \"The uncommon data inputs are not well defended by existing defense techniques while the common data are relatively easier to be defended. In particular, the binary classifier and mutation-based detection approaches are less useful in defending the uncommon data inputs (e.g., with only 5% and 10% on NIN and ResNet-20, respectively).\""
