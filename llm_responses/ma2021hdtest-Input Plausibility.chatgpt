  "why": "The paper explicitly enforces a plausibility constraint on mutated inputs during the fuzzing loop by discarding generated images that exceed a distance threshold (they give L2 < 1 as an example). This constraint is applied \"during fuzzing,\" i.e., throughout the iterative mutation process, which prevents final fault-inducing inputs from drifting into obviously unrealistic/semantically invalid instances. In addition, HDTest uses a fitness-based selection (top-N fittest seeds) guided by cosine similarity to limit which mutated candidates are carried forward, further constraining the search to inputs that remain similar in the HDC representation space. These mechanisms together indicate the authors designed the fuzzer to maintain input plausibility across iterations rather than only bounding single-step mutations.",
  "evidence": "Section IV. HDTEST FRAMEWORK (page 393): \"To ensure the added perturbations are within an 'invisible' range, we set a threshold for the distance metric during fuzzing (e.g., L2 < 1). When generated images are beyond this limit, it is regarded as unacceptable and then discarded. This constraint can be modified by the user to achieve customized and adaptive performance control when using HDTest.\"; same section: \"To maximize the efficiency of the fuzz testing process, HDTest uses distance-guided mutation for seeds update based on the distance between query HV and reference HV... only the top-N fittest seeds can survive (In our experiments, N = 3). The fitness of seeds are defined as: fitness = 1 - Cosim(AM[y], HDC(seed)), where AM[y] is the reference vector in the associative memory and HDC(seed) is the query HV of the seed, encoded by the HDC model.\""
