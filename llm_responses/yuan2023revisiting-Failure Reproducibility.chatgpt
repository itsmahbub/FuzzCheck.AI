  "why": "The paper's fuzzing/mutation design primarily uses semantic-preserving, metamorphic transformations (e.g., contrast, brightness, affine, blurring, stylizing) which tend to produce coarse, perceptible perturbations that are less likely to be lost by serialization; this aligns with the metric's allowance that metamorphic transformations provide partial enforcement of reproducibility. The authors also enforce a simple pixel-change validity constraint that bounds maximum pixel change relative to an 8-bit scale (β × 255), which is a partial consideration related to clipping/quantization. However, the paper does not explicitly account for standard I/O serialization effects (rounding, quantization, or encoding to formats like PNG/JPEG/WAV) during test case generation or oracle evaluation, nor does it generate inputs directly in serialized formats or describe steps to ensure failures persist after disk serialization. Therefore the approach partially considers serialization-related concerns (via metamorphic transforms and amplitude bounds) but does not explicitly ensure reproducibility under standard I/O operations as required for a High rating.",
  "evidence": "Sec. VI-B (Guiding Input Mutation in DNN Testing), p.1209: \"mutations in Table IX are representative, for example, blurring and stylizing (see Fig. 9) reveal the texture-bias (i.e., rely on texture to make decisions) of DNNs [7, 14].\" (Table IX lists: Pixel-Level: contrast, brightness; Affine: translation, scaling, rotation; Texture-Level: blurring, stylizing).  Sec. VI-B (Algorithm 1 description), p.1209: \"is_valid() is adopted from [47], which deems a mutation as valid if 1) the #changed-pixels is less than α× #pixels or 2) the maximum of changed pixel value is less than β ×255. We set α to 0.2 and β to 0.4.\"  (These show the use of metamorphic transformations and a pixel-value bound relative to 255.)  No sections discuss serialization/encoding/rounding/quantization or saving inputs to disk (no mention of terms such as \"PNG\", \"JPEG\", \"serialize\", \"quantize\", \"rounding\", or \"I/O\") in the design, mutation, or oracle/evaluation descriptions (see Sec. V Implementation and Sec. VI Evaluation, pp.1208–1210), indicating the lack of explicit handling of standard I/O serialization effects."
