  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility through bounded perturbations and domain-specific, rule-based mutation strategies designed to preserve semantic validity. For text-based inputs (IMDB dataset), it explicitly uses the EDA toolkit, which performs operations like synonym replacement to ensure the mutated text remains valid and meaningful. For molecular data (Lipophilicity dataset), mutations are constrained to different string representations of the same molecular structure. For continuous inputs like images (MNIST), it relies on bounded Gaussian noise and an L2-norm oracle, asserting that inputs within the norm-ball are indistinguishable to humans. The authors also provide a qualitative validation by comparing a 'natural' and comprehensible text sample generated by their tool against an incomprehensible one from a gradient-based attack (Figure 6). This approach aligns with the 'Medium' definition because it enforces plausibility through bounded/rule-based constraints and provides some validation of the final inputs. However, it does not provide a rigorous empirical evaluation of plausibility (e.g., via human studies or quantitative metrics like SSIM or Perplexity) and does not explicitly address the cumulative effects of mutations across iterations, especially for the continuous image and video domains.",
  "evidence": "Page 9, Section VII-A, '3) Input Mutation': 'The input to IMDB model is a sequence of words, on which a random change may lead to an unrecognizable (and invalid) text paragraph. To avoid this, we take a set M of mutants from the EDA toolkit [48], which was originally designed to augment the training data for improvement on text classification tasks. This ensures the mutated text paragraphs are always valid.'\n\nPage 12, Section VII-E, 'E. Comparison With Attack-Based Defect Detection (RQ6)': 'It is easy to see that the adversarial review returned by the gradient attack is hard to comprehend, whereas the one from TESTRNN is much easier.' This is supported by the visual comparison in Figure 6.\n\nPage 7, Section VI-C, '1) Test Oracle': 'The radius roracle of norm-balls intuitively means that a human cannot differentiate between inputs within a norm ball. In this article, Euclidean distance, i.e., L2-norm || · ||2 is used.'"
