  "why": "The DeepTest fuzzer intentionally steers exploration using neuron-coverage-guided transformations and uses transformation-specific metamorphic relations as an oracle to find safety-violating behaviors (e.g., steering deviations under rain/fog/lighting changes). This design pursues broader classes of unsafe or erroneous behaviors (corner cases that may cause dangerous steering), rather than aiming to induce a specific, attacker-chosen output (e.g., a particular steering angle or a chosen label). The mutation/exploration components (realistic image transformations + coverage-guided search) and the oracle (metamorphic relations that flag outputs outside an allowed error band) enable discovery of unsafe behavior classes but do not implement a mechanism to target a precise predefined output value.",
  "evidence": "Page 304, Introduction: \"we use transformation-specific metamorphic relations between multiple executions of the tested DNN (e.g., a car should behave similarly under different lighting conditions) to automatically detect erroneous corner case behaviors.\"; Page 306, Section 3.1 (Systematic Testing with Neuron Coverage): \"DeepTest tries to generate inputs that maximize neuron coverage of the test DNN.\"; Page 310, RQ4 (Can we automatically detect erroneous behaviors using metamorphic relations?): \"We call these images Ierr ... The deviations produced for Ierr are much larger than Iorg (also confirmed by Wilcoxon test for statistical significance). In fact, mean squared error (MSE) for Ierr is 0.41, while the MSE of the corresponding Iorg is 0.035.\""
