  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's methodology is fundamentally centered on maintaining input plausibility, which it terms \"conformity.\" The fuzzing design incorporates numerous mechanisms to enforce this throughout the mutation process, such as using semantic preconditions, leveraging real-world data for mutations, and performing explicit checks for consistent perspective, physical feasibility (e.g., placing a car on a road), and lighting. Most importantly, the paper provides direct empirical evidence assessing the plausibility of the final fault-inducing inputs. The authors conducted a manual study where they inspected all high-impact and a sample of moderate-impact failure-inducing images to classify them as conforming (\"true positive\") or non-conforming (\"false positive\"). The results of this human evaluation, including false positive rates and visual examples, are reported. This combination of enforcing plausibility by design and empirically validating the realism of the final outputs fully meets the criteria for a \"High\" rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 11, Section 6.4, \"...one potential issue is the presence of test cases that are nonconforming, which leads to false inconsistencies. As highlighted in Section 4, there are several factors that can result in a nonconforming test case, and determining conformity is subjective. Still, to gain a better grasp on the rate of false positives we manually inspect all the generated test cases that led to 5+ p.p. drop, and sample 10% of the test cases that led to a drop between 1 and 5 p.p.. The process entailed each author examining each image and classifying them as either a true positive or false positive. If any of the three authors deemed an image a false positive, it was conservatively recorded as such.\" This is further supported by Table 2, \"False Positive Rate for Inconsistencies Found,\" and Figure 14, which provides visual examples of both \"True Positive\" and \"False Positive\" (i.e., non-conforming) results."
