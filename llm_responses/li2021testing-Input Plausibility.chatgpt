  "why": "TACTIC performs mutations in the learned MUNIT style space (not directly on pixels) and samples/decodes style vectors into images via the trained generator. The paper explicitly represents environmental conditions as a style space learned from real-world images, initializes and searches style vectors within that space (sampling new individuals from the style space), and applies the learned decoder to produce test images. The authors further report a user study and figures showing that the synthesized scenes are realistic (comparable to GAN-based baselines and more realistic than affine/simulator-based methods). Together, this indicates the method enforces input plausibility throughout fuzzing by constraining candidate inputs to the MUNIT-learned plausible image manifold rather than producing unconstrained pixel-level noise or visually incoherent textures.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section 3.1 (Environmental Conditions): \"Therefore, we can use the style space of an environmental type in a well-trained MUNIT model to represent the environmental condition space of the type.\" \n\nPage 3, Section 3.1 (Environmental Conditions): \"Then, to produce x2, M recombines the content c1 with a style vector s2 sampled from the style space S2 of X2 by the decoder G2 of X2, i.e., x2 = G2(c1, s2).\" \n\nPage 4, Section 3.3 (Search of Critical Environmental Conditions): \"In particular, a new individual s' is firstly generated based on the current individual s... the (1+1) ES is initialised with an initial individual, which is a style vector randomly sampled from the style space in the MUNIT model.\" \n\nPage 6, Section 4.3 (Comparison with Baselines on Image Quality): \"The results demonstrate that the testing driving scenes synthesised by TACTIC are more realistic than the ones synthesised by affine image transformation (e.g., DeepTest) or high-fidelity simulation (e.g., PreScan) and can better reflect real environments.\""
