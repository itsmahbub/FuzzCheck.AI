  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper proposes DeepHunter, a fuzzing framework that uses metamorphic transformations (e.g., image brightness, rotation, scaling) to generate new test cases. The assessment metric explicitly states that applying semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization corresponds to a 'Medium' rating. DeepHunter's methodology for validating mutations, described in Section 3.2.2 and Algorithm 2, applies constraints based on L0 and L∞ norms (Equation 1) to limit the magnitude of pixel-level changes. These constraints operate on the in-memory, likely floating-point, representation of the image and do not account for I/O effects like rounding or quantization that occur when serializing an image to a standard file format (e.g., 8-bit PNG). A small, fault-inducing floating-point perturbation (e.g., changing a pixel value from 155.0 to 155.4) could be generated and trigger a failure in memory, but this perturbation would be lost upon serialization as it would be rounded back to 155, making the failure non-reproducible from the stored artifact. The paper does not describe any mechanism to ensure that the generated mutations persist after a save-and-reload cycle.",
  "evidence": "Page 5, Section 3.2.2, Metamorphic Mutation: \"To increase the changeability of mutation, we select eight image transformations of two categories: • Pixel Value transformation P: image contrast, image brightness, image blur, and image noise. • Affine transformation G: image translation, image scaling, image shearing, and image rotation.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 3.2.2: \"A Pixel Value Transformation can be used multiple times for increasing the changeability, we use Lo and L∞ to constrain the pixel-level changes. Suppose an image s' is mutated from s by a pixel value transformation, then s' is valid if f(s, s') is satisfied.\"\n\nPage 6, Equation (1): The validity function f(s, s') is defined using L0(s, s') (number of changed pixels) and L∞(s, s') (maximum value of a pixel's change). This formulation constrains the magnitude of mutations but does not model or account for serialization effects such as rounding fractional changes to integers, which is critical for ensuring failure reproducibility from saved files."
