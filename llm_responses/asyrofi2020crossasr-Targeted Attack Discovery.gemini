  "why": "The method described in the paper, CrossASR, performs untargeted exploration to find generic failures in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Its objective is to identify any audio input that is incorrectly transcribed by an ASR, which constitutes a generic misclassification or inaccuracy. The system uses differential testing, comparing the outputs of multiple ASRs against the original text used for audio synthesis. A failure is declared when one ASR's transcription does not match the input text, while another ASR's transcription does. This is a classic untargeted approach focused on finding inconsistencies. The system includes a 'failure probability predictor' to guide the selection of input texts, but its purpose is to increase the efficiency of finding *any* failure, not to steer the system towards generating a specific, predefined output phrase or a broader class of security-violating content. The entire methodology is designed to reveal generic prediction inconsistencies rather than discover targeted attacks.",
  "evidence": "Page 3, Section II-A, Case 2: 'If the ASR-transcribed text does not match the text input to TTS and there is another ASR's transcribed text that matches with the text input to TTS, CrossASR determines the speech audio as a failed test case.' This definition of a failure is based on a generic mismatch (inaccuracy) and inconsistency between systems, not on achieving a targeted output. The examples of failures found, such as 'consulted' being transcribed as 'controlled' (Table IX, page 8), further demonstrate that the discovered faults are generic transcription errors."
