  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's differential-testing approach (CrossASR++) identifies failures solely as cases where the ASR under test mis-transcribes a synthesized audio compared to the input text. The evaluation and improvements are measured by counts of such failed test cases and by word error rate (WER), classic robustness metrics for mispredictions. The paper contains no description or experiments that uncover unsafe, biased, hallucinated outputs, privacy/data-leakage, authorization bypasses, jailbreaks, or any bypassing of explicit safety/security mechanisms. Therefore the failures exposed are model robustness errors (mispredictions) and correspond to the 'Low' severity category.",
  "evidence": "Page 675, Section II.A (CrossASR++): \"The generated audio file is then fed to all ASR systems inside CrossASR++ (SUT and ASR1 to ASRm in Fig. 1). The tool cross-references the outputs of these ASR systems and tags the synthesized audio-text pair as a valid test case if at least one of the ASR systems can successfully transcribe the audio (i.e., each word in the transcription matches each corresponding word in the input text). A valid test case can be either a failed test case or a successful test case. If the SUT transcription is different from the input text, it means that CrossASR++ uncovers a failed test case for the SUT.\" Page 677, Section III.C (Preliminary Evaluation): \"For the second evaluation, the WER is the most common metric to evaluate the performance of ASR systems... The WER is computed as follows: WER = (I + D + S) / N.\" (These passages show failures are defined as mispredictions and evaluated by WER; no safety/security violations or bypassing of defenses are discussed anywhere in the paper.)"
