  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "MDPFuzz mutates MDP environment/state parameters (semantic, metamorphic transformations) rather than performing fine-grained in-memory tensor perturbations, so the generated inputs are produced by the simulator (rendered frames, environment states) and are inherently more stable than ephemeral floating-point tensor mutations. However, the paper does not describe any explicit handling or checks for standard I/O/serialization effects (quantization, rounding, clipping) nor does it claim to generate inputs directly in serialized formats to ensure persistence of fault-inducing perturbations. Under the metric definition, this corresponds to “semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization,” which maps to Medium.",
  "evidence": "Section 4 (p. 381) — \"Mutating Initial States vs. Mutating Intermediate States. ... We thus decide to only mutate the initial state (e.g., re-arrange the environment at timestep 0), allowing to preserve the coherence of the entire MDP state sequence.\" \n\nSection 6 (p. 385) — \"We add random noise to the initial states and the noise type depends on type of the original data, e.g., adding small Gaussian float numbers from N(0, 1) to vehicles' initial positions, and adding small uniform integers from U(0, 4) to the ground type in BipedalWalker.\" \n\nSection 6 (p. 385) — \"Particularly, in CARLA, we change the initial positions and angles of all 100 vehicles, including the model-controlled vehicle. Note that CARLA validates and rejects abnormal initial states: all mutated initial states passed its validation.\" \n\n(Throughout the paper, mutation and validation are described as operating on environment/state parameters and simulator-rendered frames; there is no discussion of handling standard I/O serialization effects such as pixel quantization, rounding, clipping, nor any explicit mechanism to constrain perturbations to survive common serialization.)"
