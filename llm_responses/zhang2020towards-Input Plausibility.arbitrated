  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "While the authors constrain individual mutations via an L∞ bound on the noise added (and avoid affine transforms that might break image validity), they do not describe any mechanism to enforce that all evolved candidates remain within a global L∞ ball around the original seed or otherwise filter out inputs that have drifted too far over multiple generations. Thus plausibility is guaranteed step-by-step but cumulative drift across the GA is not explicitly controlled.",
  "evidence": "Page 746, Section 4 (Population Initialization): “In order to generate high-quality images (i.e., recognizable by human), we … use L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed and its generated counterpart.” \n\nPage 746, Section 4 (Crossover and Mutation): “After the crossover, each image is randomly mutated by adding white noise …” \n\nPage 746, Section 5.1 (RQ3 Setting): “For the mutation process, the radius of L∞ is set as 0.3.”"
