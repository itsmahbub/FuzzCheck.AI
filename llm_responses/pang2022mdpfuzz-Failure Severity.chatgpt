  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper demonstrates that MDPFuzz uncovers high-impact, safety-related failures (explicitly defined as crashes such as vehicle or airplane collisions) across multiple real-world MDP scenarios (autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, multi-agent navigation, etc.). These are violations of user safety expectations (unsafe/undesired outputs). However, the paper does not claim to bypass explicit safety- or security-focused defenses, nor does it evaluate or report bypassing defended or safety-aligned models (e.g., adversarially trained or policy-gated systems) or revealing security-critical behaviors like data leakage or jailbreaks. Thus the appropriate classification is Medium: it uncovers unsafe, high-impact outputs but does not demonstrate bypassing explicit safety/security mechanisms.",
  "evidence": "Page 378, Abstract: \"MDPFuzz forms testing oracles by checking whether the target model enters abnormal and dangerous states.\"; Page 378, Abstract: \"We evaluate five state-of-the-art models for solving MDPs, including supervised DNN, RL, IL, and multi-agent RL... During a 12-hour run, we find over 80 crash-triggering state sequences on each model.\"; Page 385, Section 6 (Testing Oracles (Crash Definition)): \"For DNN-based ACAS Xu, we check collisions of the DNN-controlled airplane with other airplanes.\"; Page 381, Section 4 (Definition 2): \"We regard crashes incurred from a valid and solvable initial state as bugs of a model pi solving MDP.\"; Page 385, Section 6 (MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation): \"We guarantee that there exist optimal actions to avoid the crash and we do not use an initial state that is not solvable.\"; Page 382, Section 5 (Assumptions): \"In blackbox settings, the internal of the agent model (our testing target) is not revealed to MDPFuzz... MDPFuzz has no access to the blackbox model internals.\""
