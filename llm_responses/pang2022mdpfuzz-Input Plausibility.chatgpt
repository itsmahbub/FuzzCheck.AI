  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility throughout fuzzing by (1) restricting mutations to the initial MDP state (to preserve inter-state coherence), (2) applying small, bounded/random-noise mutations, and (3) validating every mutated initial state using environment validation/solvability checks before using it (Mutate_Validate) or adding it to the seed corpus. These mechanisms are applied repeatedly during fuzzing (i.e., each mutated initial state is validated), which prevents drifting to unrealistic or semantically invalid inputs across iterations.",
  "evidence": "Sec. 4 (Mutating Initial States vs. Mutating Intermediate States), p. 381: \"We thus decide to only mutate the initial state (e.g., re-arrange the environment at timestep 0), allowing to preserve the coherence of the entire MDP state sequence. For each MDP scenario, we validate mutated initial states in a deliberate way to ensure they are realistic and solvable for an optimal model π*; see MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation in Sec. 6.\" Algorithm 1 (Fuzzing), (Alg. 1, line 13) shows the Mutate_Validate step used during fuzzing (i.e., mutated states are validated before use). Sec. 6 (MDP Initial State Sampling, Mutation, and Validation), pp. 384–385: \"We emphasize that: When sampling, the initial states are randomly selected from the state space P. MDPFuzz randomly mutates initial states with small noise. All the mutated states are validated in an automated and deliberate way (see below). That is, we confirm that all mutated states are valid and solvable.\" Sec. 6 (implementation details / CARLA example), p. 385: \"Particularly, in CARLA, we change the initial positions and angles of all 100 vehicles... Note that CARLA validates and rejects abnormal initial states: all mutated initial states passed its validation. ... We guarantee that there exist optimal actions to avoid the crash and we do not use an initial state that is not solvable.\" Sec. 5.1 (Sensitivity / mutation magnitude), p. 383: \"Sensitivity adds small random permutations ΔS to an initial state S0 ... The local sensitivity of the model at S0 can thus be estimated by |r - rΔ| / ||ΔS||2,\" and Sec. 6: \"We add random noise to the initial states and the noise type depends on type of the original data, e.g., adding small Gaussian float numbers from N(0,1) to vehicles’ initial positions...\""
