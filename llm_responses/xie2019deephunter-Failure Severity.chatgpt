  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper defines and evaluates DeepHunter solely in terms of detecting mispredictions and model inconsistencies under semantically-preserving input mutations (including quantization-induced inconsistencies). All formal definitions of failures are phrased as erroneous predictions or quantization inconsistencies (Definitions 2 and 3). The evaluation uses standard image-classification datasets and pre-trained models (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet; LeNet, ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) and measures numbers/diversity of 'errors' and 'quantization erroneous behavior'. There is no design, experiment, or claim that DeepHunter targets bypassing explicit safety/policy mechanisms, safety-aligned or adversarially-defended models, or higher-severity behaviours like jailbreaks, data leakage, or unauthorized actions. Therefore the failures it uncovers are robustness/misprediction errors (low severity) rather than high-impact safety/security violations.",
  "evidence": "Page 149, Section 3.2.1 (Test Oracle): \"Definition 2. Given a DNN F, a human oracle O, a metamorphic mutation strategy M and a test x satisfying F(x) = O(x), a mutant x' in M(x) is an erroneous behavior of F if F(x') != F(x).\"; \"Definition 3. ... a mutant x' in M(x) is a quantization erroneous behavior between F and F' if ... F(x') != F(x).\" (these definitions show failures are mispredictions or quantization inconsistencies).\n\nPage 149, Section 3.2.2 (Metamorphic Mutation): \"... this paper focuses on the image domain, one of the most widely studied domains.\" (shows scope limited to image classification robustness).\n\nPage 151, Section 4 (Experimental Design and Settings), Datasets and DNN Models: \"We select three popular publicly available datasets (i.e., MNIST [29], CIFAR-10 [27], and ImageNet [41]) ... we study several popular pre-trained DNN models\" (shows evaluation on standard models, not defended/safety-aligned models).\n\nPage 154, Section 5.4 (RQ4 Summary): \"With corner-region based criteria, DeepHunter tends to be more useful for detecting errors introduced during the DNN quantization.\" (shows emphasis on detecting quantization-related misprediction errors).\n\nSection 6 (Related Work, Testing): \"Different from DeepXplore and DiffChaser which focus on differential testing, DeepHunter is a grey-box testing technique focusing on a single DNN model.\" (indicates the method targets single-model robustness testing rather than bypassing policy/safeguards)."
