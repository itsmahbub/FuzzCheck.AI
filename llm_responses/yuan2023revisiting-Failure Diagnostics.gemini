  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic analysis that explains why failures occur by linking them to underlying model vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the fuzzing evaluation (Section VI-B), the authors intentionally select mutation operators (blurring, stylizing) that are known to reveal 'texture-bias,' a model's reliance on spurious features rather than semantic shapes. By guiding mutations with their proposed metric (NLC) and analyzing the resulting failures, they connect the discovered errors to this specific vulnerability. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the statistical patterns of the failures by measuring the diversity of erroneous behaviors through the number of affected classes and the scaled entropy of their distribution. This analysis is explicitly framed as a way of 'uncovering a practically larger vulnerability surface of DNN models,' thus connecting specific failures to a broader model weakness.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section VI-B, \"Setup\": \"mutations in Table IX are representative, for example, blurring and stylizing (see Fig. 9) reveal the texture-bias (i.e., rely on texture to make decisions) of DNNs [7, 14].\"\n\nPage 11, Section VI-B, \"Diversity of Erroneous Behaviors\": \"A higher diversity of erroneous behaviors indicates uncovering a practically larger vulnerability surface of DNN models. Overall, a collection of fault-triggering images are regarded as more diverse if they cover more classes. In case that #covered classes is equal, we further use the scaled entropy... to assess the diversity: a higher entropy is better. The results are also presented in Table XI. It is seen that fault-triggering images generated by using NLC as the guidance cover the most classes.\""
