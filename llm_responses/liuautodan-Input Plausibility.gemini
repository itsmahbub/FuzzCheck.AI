  "why": "The paper's primary objective is to generate 'stealthy' and 'semantically meaningful' jailbreak prompts, which directly aligns with the concept of input plausibility. The proposed method, AutoDAN, enforces this plausibility throughout its generation process. Unlike methods that perform simple token-level mutations, AutoDAN employs a hierarchical genetic algorithm that operates on sentences and words. Crucially, its mutation operator uses an LLM to revise sentences, a mechanism designed to preserve logical flow and meaning, thus preventing the cumulative semantic drift common in iterative fuzzing. Furthermore, the paper provides explicit empirical evidence of this plausibility. It uses Sentence Perplexity (PPL), a standard quantitative measure for linguistic fluency, as a core evaluation metric for 'stealthiness'. The results demonstrate that AutoDAN's generated prompts have significantly lower (i.e., better) perplexity scores than token-based attack baselines (GCG) and are comparable to human-written prompts, confirming that the final fault-inducing inputs are realistic and semantically valid.",
  "evidence": "Page 7, Section 4.1, Metrics: \"For stealthiness, we use standard Sentence Perplexity (PPL) evaluated by GPT-2 as the metric.\"\n\nPage 7, Section 4.2, Table 1 & Attack Effectiveness and Stealthiness: The results in Table 1 show AutoDAN-HGA achieving a PPL of 54.3820 on Llama2-7b-chat, vastly lower than the GCG baseline's 1027.5585. The text states: \"Compared with the baseline, our method exhibits superior performance in terms of PPL, indicating more semantically meaningful and stealthy attacks being generated.\"\n\nPage 6, Section 3.4.2, Paragraph-level: selection, crossover and mutation: \"We let the LLM-based diversification introduced in Alg. 5 to also serve as the mutation function due to its ability to preserve the global meaning and introduce diversity.\" Algorithm 5 on page 14 details this function, which instructs an LLM to revise a sentence, thus enforcing semantic plausibility during the mutation step."
