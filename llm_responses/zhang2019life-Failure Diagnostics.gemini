  "why": "The paper provides a diagnostic analysis that explains why the observed failures (semantic misinterpretations, or 'LAPSUS') occur by linking them to a fundamental vulnerability in the system's design. First, the evaluation methodologically isolates the failing component, empirically demonstrating that the 'Intent Classifier' is the primary source of the problem, rather than the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Second, through a case study and analysis, the paper identifies a clear failure pattern: vApps with simple, unique names are more robust, while those with longer, more complex names are more vulnerable to misinterpretation. Finally, it explicitly connects this pattern to an underlying architectural vulnerability: the 'current template-based Intent Classifier design'. This design aggregates command templates from numerous third-party developers, creating a shared namespace where attackers can intentionally register commands that are linguistically similar to legitimate ones, thus enabling 'vApp squatting' attacks. This explanation moves beyond correlating failures with input characteristics and identifies the root cause within the model's design and operational context.",
  "evidence": "Page 13, Section D, Case Study, \"Security Implication: The aforementioned results show that simple and unique names are more difficult to be misspoken according to our linguistic models. With the current template-based Intent Classifier design, using simple and unique voice commands is the most effective way of preventing vApp squatting attacks. However, it is difficult to achieve given the increasingly growing vApp population.\""
