  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper evaluates NLC by using it to find mispredictions and adversarial examples (robustness errors) in standard discriminative and generative models. All reported failures are incorrect model outputs (prediction errors) induced by input mutations or adversarial attacks (e.g., CW, PGD). The paper does not demonstrate uncovering safety- or security-critical violations (such as bypassing explicit safety/policy mechanisms, jailbreaks, data leakage, or unauthorized actions), nor does it evaluate models with explicit defense or safety-alignment mechanisms. Therefore the failures uncovered are limited to low-impact model robustness errors.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (page 1200): \"Its capacity to discover DNN prediction errors is promising.\" | VI.A, 2) Fault-Revealing Capability of Test Suites (page 1207–1208): \"To evaluate the fault-revealing capabilities of test suites, we construct adversarial examples (AE) using two adversarial attack algorithms, Carlini/Wagner (CW) [9] and Project Gradient Descent (PGD) [31]... all algorithms attacking the three models reach over 98% success rates. That is, more than 0.98 × (#training data) AEs can trigger erroneous behaviors.\" | VIB (Guiding Input Mutation) / Triggered Faults (page 1209): \"Images mutated under the guidance of NLC (last row) have the highest error triggering rates compared with random mutation (3rd row) and other criteria...\" | Model list (page 1206, Table II): lists ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet-V2, BigGAN, LSTM (standard discriminative and generative models; no defended/safety-aligned models reported)."
