  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper does not demonstrate attack transferability. MDPFuzz evaluates and finds crash-triggering initial states per target model (it reports crashes separately for five different models/scenarios), uses those findings to train per-model detectors and to repair individual models, and explicitly operates in blackbox settings without building surrogate models. The paper contains no experiment where fault-inducing inputs found on one model are reused to test another model, nor does it describe mechanisms (e.g., surrogate-model attacks, cross-model validation, or explicit cross-model transfer tests) intended to discover transferable attacks across different model implementations.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.378): \"We evaluate five state-of-the-art models for solving MDPs, including supervised DNN, RL, IL, and multi-agent RL.\" (shows multiple models were evaluated but not that inputs were reused across them). \n\nSection 7.1 RQ1 / Results (p.386): \"Table 3 summarizes the findings of fuzzing each model... Overall, MDPFuzz detects a significant number of crashes from all test cases.\" (reports per-model crash counts; no cross-model reuse reported). \n\nSection 5 Assumptions (Alg.1 / p.382): \"In blackbox settings, the internal of the agent model (our testing target) is not revealed to MDPFuzz... MDPFuzz can collect the state sequence {S_t} and obtain the cumulative reward r from the environment.\" (describes blackbox testing and lack of building surrogate/internal models). \n\nSection 7.4 (p.387): \"we repair the models used by DNN-based ACAS Xu with the findings of MDPFuzz...\" (describes per-model repair using findings, not transfer of fault-inducing inputs to other models). \n\nSection 8 Discussion (p.388): \"Another threat is that bugs may be potentially overlooked since MDPFuzz only mutates the entry states (Sec. 5). Nevertheless ...\" (limits of their approach are discussed; no claim of enabling transferable/substitute-model attacks)."
