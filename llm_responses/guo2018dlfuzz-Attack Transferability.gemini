  "why": "The paper presents DLFuzz as a method for testing a single Deep Learning (DL) system in isolation. A core contribution highlighted is its ability to find incorrect behaviors without needing \"cross-referencing oracles from other DL systems with the same functionality.\" The methodology focuses on generating adversarial inputs for one specific model under test by maximizing prediction differences between an original and a mutated input for that same model. The experimental evaluation, while conducted on multiple models (e.g., LeNet-1, LeNet-4, VGG-16), treats each model as an independent target. The results are reported on a per-model basis, and there is no mention of any experiment where fault-inducing inputs generated for one model are used to test another model to assess transferability.",
  "evidence": "Page 2, Abstract: \"DLFuzz keeps minutely mutating the input to maximize the neuron coverage and the prediction difference between the original input and the mutated input, without manual labeling effort or cross-referencing oracles from other DL systems with the same functionality.\"\n\nPage 5, Section 5, Conclusion: \"DLFuzz also overcomes the trouble of relying on multiple DL systems of the similar functionality in DeepXplore.\"\n\nPage 5, Table 1: \"Effectiveness of DLFuzz compared with DeepXplore.\" This table presents the results for each model (LeNet-1, LeNet-4, LeNet-5, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) individually, comparing DLFuzz to DeepXplore on that specific model. There is no data or discussion regarding the transferability of adversarial inputs generated for one model to any of the others."
