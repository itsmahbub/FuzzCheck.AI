  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's methodology for generating test inputs, which are text-based prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), inherently ensures that the inputs remain plausible within the domain of natural language and the specific threat model of jailbreak attacks. The paper uses three main methods for generating varied inputs: paraphrasing, appending adversarial suffixes, and iterative prompt rewriting. For paraphrasing synonymous queries and for iteratively generating new jailbreak test cases, the paper employs GPT-4. Using a powerful language model like GPT-4 for rewriting and paraphrasing acts as a strong constraint, ensuring that the generated prompts are grammatically correct, coherent, and semantically meaningful. This method ensures that mutated inputs remain within a plausible distribution of human-readable text, directly aligning with the 'High' rating's requirement. While the adversarial suffixes generated by GCG might appear unusual, they represent a realistic and documented threat model for LLM jailbreaking, and thus are considered plausible within this specific context.",
  "evidence": "Page 11, Section V-C, Jailbreak Case Generation, Setup: 'Setup: We use Llama-2-7b-chat as the target model, initializing with five jailbreak queries as seeds. Over five iterations, GPT-4 generates ten new jailbreak queries per round through prompt rewriting.' \nPage 3, Section III-A, Experimental Setup: 'Synonymous queries are the paraphrased versions of normal queries by GPT-4, intended to trigger the same normal behaviors as the original queries.'\nPage 6, Section IV-A, Synonymous Query Dataset: 'To construct synonymous queries, we use GPT-4 to generate corresponding synonymous paraphrases for the first 500 queries from the Alpaca-gpt4 dataset and manually verify that the synonymous queries produce outputs similar to the original queries...'"
