  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility constraints on inputs (e.g., restricting inputs to valid shapes/ranges and providing a bounded L∞ mutation option relative to an original seed) and explicitly uses such bounded perturbations in at least one experiment (the quantization experiment where mutations are restricted to an L∞ ball). However, the paper does not report any explicit empirical assessment of the perceptual or semantic realism of final fault-inducing inputs (no human study or task-specific perceptual/fluency metrics such as LPIPS/SSIM/PESQ/STOI/Perplexity are provided). Thus TensorFuzz enforces plausibility via bounded/rule-based constraints in mutation design and uses them in experiments, but it does not provide quantitative or human-evaluation evidence that final failing inputs remain perceptually/semantically realistic across fuzzing iterations.",
  "evidence": "Section 4 (An Overview of the TensorFuzz Library): \"we restrict the inputs to those that are valid neural network inputs. If the inputs are images, we restrict our inputs to have the correct size and shape, and to lie in the same interval as the input pixels of the dataset under consideration. If the inputs are sequences of characters, we only allow characters that are in the vocabulary extracted from the training set.\" \n\nSection 5 (Details — Mutator): \"For image inputs, we implemented two different types of mutation. The first is to just add white noise of a user-configurable variance to the input. The second is to add white noise, but to constrain the difference between the mutated element and the original element from which it is descended to have a user-configurable L∞ norm. This type of constrained mutation can be useful if we want to find inputs that satisfy some objective function, but are still plausibly of the same 'class' as the original input that was used as a seed. In both types of image mutation we clip the image after mutation so that it lies in the same range as the inputs used to train the neural network being fuzzed.\" \n\nSection 6 (Experimental Results — Quantization experiment): \"We then ran the fuzzer with mutations restricted to lie in a radius 0.4 infinity norm ball surrounding the seed images, using the activations of only the 32-bit model as coverage. We restrict to inputs near seed images because these inputs nearly all have unambiguous class semantics.\" \n\nAbsence of empirical plausibility evaluation: The paper describes mutation constraints and uses bounded perturbations in experiments but contains no section or statements reporting human evaluation or task-specific perceptual/fluency metrics (e.g., LPIPS, SSIM, PESQ, STOI, Perplexity) for the final fault-inducing inputs."
