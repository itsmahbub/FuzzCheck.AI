  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's LipFuzzer uncovers misinterpretations in the NLU Intent Classifier that lead to violations of user intent and security expectations (e.g., vApp squatting, installation/invocation hijacks, phishing, privacy leakage, and device-control denial-of-service). These are higher-impact than simple robustness errors. However, the work does not claim to target or bypass explicit safety- or security-aligned defenses (e.g., adversarially trained or safety-filtered models); instead it exploits template/intent-matching design flaws and developer-supplied templates in a black-box setting. Therefore the failures found are severe (unsafe, unauthorized behaviors and privacy/security consequences) but are not described as bypassing explicit defended/safety-aligned mechanisms, which matches the metric's \"Medium\" category.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (p.1): \"...the semantic inconsistency caused by the improper semantic interpretation of an Intent Classifier can create the opportunity of breaching the integrity of vApp processing when attackers delicately leverage some common spoken errors.\"; II.D Threat Model (p.4): \"Attack consequences. We summarize a list of example consequences of interacting with malicious vApps as follows: Denial of Service: This would occur if a device-controlling vApp is hijacked. Privacy Leakage: vApps intimately connect users’ daily life to a more exposed digital world... Phishing: Third-party vApps’ back-end processing is fully controlled by the developers...\"; VI-C vApp Store Evaluation (p.12): \"As a result, a total of 715 (71.5%) Amazon Alexa vApps and 59 (29.5%) Google Assistant are verified to be vulnerable.\"; VI-D Case Study - Attacking 'True Bank' (p.13): \"As a result, a total number of 3 malicious vApps are invoked, which clearly demonstrate the practicability of the attack.\"; II.D Threat Model (p.4): \"We assume that an adversary does not need to access any internal implementations/configurations of vApp including ASR, NLU components.\""
