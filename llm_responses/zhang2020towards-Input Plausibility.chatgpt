  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility constraints during generation (bounded pixel perturbations and avoiding certain transformations) but does not provide any empirical evaluation (human study or perceptual/semantic similarity metrics) of the final fault-inducing inputs. Concretely, KuK’s GA uses L_infty bounds and avoids affine/crossover operations that would create invalid images, which constrains individual mutation steps and initialization relative to the original seed. However, the authors do not report task-specific perceptual/semantic measures (e.g., SSIM/LPIPS) or any human evaluation to demonstrate that the final uncommon AEs/BEs remain perceptually or semantically realistic. This matches the metric’s “Medium” level: plausibility is enforced by bounded/rule-based constraints but final-input plausibility is not validated empirically.",
  "evidence": "Section 4 (Uncommon Data Generation) and Section 5.1 (RQ3 setting):\n\n1) Constraint on mutations / avoiding invalid transforms (Section 4, Population Initialization): \"In order to generate high-quality images (i.e., recognizable by human), we abandon the affine transformation (e.g., translation and rotation [55]) as the crossover may generate invalid images. We use L∞ norm to constrain the allowable changes between the original seed and its generated counterpart.\" (Section 4, p. 746)\n\n2) Explicit L∞ mutation radius in evaluation settings (Section 5.1): \"For the mutation process, the radius of L∞ is set as 0.3.\" (Section 5.1, p. 746)\n\n3) Lack of explicit perceptual / human plausibility assessment: the paper’s evaluations (RQ3/RQ4) report counts, PCS/VRO statistics and defense success rates but contain no reported human study or task-specific perceptual/semantic metrics (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS, PESQ, STOI, or Perplexity) for final fault-inducing inputs. For example, the experimental descriptions and results focus on generated counts and PCS/VRO distributions (Tables 4–6) and defense bypass rates (Section 5.2), but no perceptual-quality or human-evaluation results are presented (Sections 3–5, pp. 743–748)."
