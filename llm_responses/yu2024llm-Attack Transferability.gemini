  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper satisfies both conditions for a 'High' rating. First, it explicitly tests the transferability of the jailbreak templates generated by LLM-FUZZER. Templates are created using a set of three models and then evaluated against a larger, diverse set of unseen open-source and commercial LLMs. Second, the fuzzing design incorporates an explicit mechanism to support the discovery of transferable failures. Specifically for the transferability experiment, the reward mechanism of the fuzzer is modified to query multiple models simultaneously and penalize templates that are not universally effective, thereby actively guiding the fuzzer towards generating transferable jailbreaks.",
  "evidence": "Page 10-11, Section 4.2, Experiment Design: \"Experiment III. To address the question of transferability, we chose to create templates using gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, Llama-2-7B-Chat, and Vicuna-7B. This approach was taken to ensure that the generated templates would be applicable across various LLMs. We followed a similar procedure with the previous experiment but made two slight modifications. First, in each fuzzing iteration, we queried 100 questions for each template across all three models, resulting in a total of 300 responses. Second, in the template reward assignment by the oracle, a zero reward was imposed if the template's all successful jailbreak attempts were attributed solely to one or two LLMs. This modification aimed to bolster universality by discouraging the generation of templates that could exploit only one or two specific LLMs.\""
