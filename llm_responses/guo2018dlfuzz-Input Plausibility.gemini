  "value": "High",
  "why": "The method enforces input plausibility throughout the fuzzing process by explicitly constraining the cumulative perturbation of any mutated input relative to the original seed. The core mutation algorithm iteratively generates new inputs and adds them to a seed list for further fuzzing only if two conditions are met: neuron coverage improves and the L2 distance between the newly mutated input and the *original* input is small. This direct comparison to the original input prevents the cumulative drift that can lead to unrealistic artifacts, ensuring that all generated inputs remain within a plausible distribution centered on the initial seed. The paper repeatedly emphasizes that this constraint is designed to ensure the \"imperceptibility\" of perturbations.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Algorithm 1, line 15: The algorithm defines the distance check as `l2_distance = distance(x', x) // measure the perturbation`. Here, `x'` is the newly mutated input generated from a seed `xs`, and `x` is the original input from the initial test set. This shows the check is cumulative, not just between successive steps. \n\nPage 4, Section 3.2, Fuzzing Process: \"As for the conditions of seed keeping in line 16, DLFuzz limits our desired distance to a relatively small range (less than 0.02) to ensure the imperceptibility.\"\n\nPage 5, Section 4.3, Without Manual Effort: \"The adversarial inputs are nearly the same as the original input, and the perturbations are imperceptible.\""
