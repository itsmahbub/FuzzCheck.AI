  "why": "The paper proposes QATest, a fuzzing framework based on metamorphic testing. The core principle is to apply semantically preserving transformations to input questions and check for prediction inconsistencies. A failure is defined as the model producing a different answer for the transformed question compared to the original, i.e., `M(q') ≠ M(q)`. This directly aligns with the definition of uncovering model robustness errors. The paper's case study of detected failures (RQ4) categorizes them as various types of incorrect answers, such as answering an answerable question with `<NoAnswer>`, providing answers unrelated to the question, or extracting the wrong keywords. These are all examples of mispredictions or inconsistencies. The paper does not test against models with explicit safety mechanisms, nor does it aim to produce or evaluate unsafe, toxic, or biased outputs.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 3.2.1, Test Oracle: \"Metamorphic Relations (MRs) refer to the relationship expected to be followed between input and output when the target program is executed multiple times. ... We define a series of semantically consistent transformations T for questions q e Q. The generated question q' can be obtained by applying the transformation t∈T to the original question q, and q' has the same intent and meaning as q. Therefore, the QA system should output the same answer for the q and q'.\"\n\nPage 10, Section 5.4, Answer to RQ4: Case Study: \"In this RQ, we investigate and classify the erroneous behaviors of the QA system detected by QATest. In Table 6, we show five types of representative erroneous behaviors. ... (2) Answerable questions are answered with <NoAnswer>. ... the question has a corresponding answer in the context, but the system can't find a matching answer and outputs <NoAnswer>. (3) Answers that are unrelated to the question. Another type of error is that the QA system's answers are not related to the question. In example 3, the question is asking about the year, but the output of the QA system is a person's name.\""
