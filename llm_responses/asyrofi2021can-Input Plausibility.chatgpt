  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper's test-generation design produces audio inputs by synthesizing natural texts from a real corpus (Europarl) via a TTS system and explicitly filters out implausible synthesized audios by requiring at least one ASR to correctly transcribe the audio (cross-referencing). Inputs are selected from an authentic text distribution (not created via incremental adversarial/perturbation mutations), and the tool trains a failure estimator to prioritize real corpus texts. These design choices ensure generated inputs remain within a plausible input distribution throughout iterations rather than drifting via cumulative, unconstrained perturbations.",
  "evidence": "Pg. 675, Section II.A (CrossASR++): \"CrossASR++ takes a text corpus as input and tries to generate a test case for the ASR system under test (SUT). Specifically, given a piece of text from the corpus, it first employs a TTS system to synthesize an audio file from the text.\" \n\nPg. 675, Section II.A (CrossASR++): \"To avoid using the invalid audios synthesized by the TTS system, the generated audio-text pair is fed into multiple ASR systems for cross-referencing: If at least one ASR system correctly recognizes the audio, the audio-text pair is viewed as a valid test case.\" \n\nPg. 676, Section III.A (Dataset): \"We use the Europarl dataset... It contains 20,000 texts that are randomly picked...\" \n\n(These passages show inputs are synthesized from an authentic text corpus using TTS and are explicitly validated via cross-referencing to enforce plausibility across iterations.)"
