  "why": "The paper presents Adapt as a white-box testing technique that operates on a single target DNN (Algorithm 2 takes a single DNN as input) and evaluates it per-model. The experiments report per-model coverage and adversarial inputs but do not test or report whether fault-inducing inputs produced on one model transfer to other models. The authors explicitly note that DeepXplore's differential (multi-DNN) testing was not used in its multi-model mode: “we used it with a single DNN and labeled data in our experiments.” There is no experiment, analysis, or mechanism described to generate or evaluate transferable (cross-model) fault-inducing inputs or surrogate-model attacks. Therefore the paper does not demonstrate attack transferability across models.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 (Algorithm 2): \"1: procedure Adapt(DNN, I,Cov)\" (Algorithm 2 signature shows Adapt operates on a single DNN) — (page 168, Section 3.2, Algorithm 2).\n\nSection 4.1 Experimental Setup: \"DeepXplore originally performs differential testing requiring multiple DNNs without labeled data but we used it with a single DNN and labeled data in our experiments.\" (shows the authors evaluated tools in single-model mode and did not perform multi-model/differential transfer experiments) — (page 170, Section 4.1 Experimental Setup).\n\nOverall evaluation description and results (Sections 4.2–4.3) report per-model coverage and adversarial inputs but contain no experiments or discussion on reusing inputs across models or on surrogate-model transferability — (pages 171–173, Sections 4.2–4.3)."
