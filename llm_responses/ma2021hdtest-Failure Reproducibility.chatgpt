  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzing/mutation design applies fine-grained numerical perturbations (e.g., Gaussian and random noise) and evaluates adversariality entirely by sending in-memory mutated inputs to the HDC classifier, but it does not account for standard I/O serialization effects (quantization, rounding, clipping) nor constrain mutations to guarantee they survive serialization. The authors explicitly describe adding gaussian/random noise and using an L2-distance threshold to keep perturbations 'invisible', and they evaluate success by comparing predictions on the original and mutated inputs in memory. Nowhere do they describe converting/saving mutated inputs to common serialized formats (e.g., 8-bit images) or handling clipping/rounding so that failures remain reproducible after standard I/O operations. Because I/O/serialization effects are ignored, fault-inducing perturbations could be lost or altered when inputs are serialized, so the paper meets the 'Low' level of the metric.",
  "evidence": "Section III.A Encoding (page 392): \"For the MNIST dataset we use in this paper, since the image size is 28×28 and the pixel range is 0 to 255 in greyscale, we flat a single image into an array with 784 elements with values ranging from 0 to 255.\" \n\nSection IV HDTest Framework / Mutation algorithm (page 393): Algorithm 1 and surrounding text describe in-memory comparison: \"Both the generated input and the original input are then sent to the HDC classifier for prediction. We then check if the two predicted labels are different, and if yes, this indicates a successful generation of an adversarial input.\" (Alg.1 lines and paragraph) \n\nSection IV Mutation strategies / Table I (page 393): lists fine-grained numerical mutations such as \"gauss apply gaussian noise over the entire image\" and \"rand apply random noise over the entire image.\" \n\nSection IV (page 394): \"To ensure the added perturbations are within an 'invisible' range, we set a threshold for the distance metric during fuzzing (e.g., L2 < 1). When generated images are beyond this limit, it is regarded as unacceptable and then discarded.\" \n\n(There is no discussion in the paper of serialization, saving mutated inputs to standard image/audio formats, quantization, rounding, or explicit handling of clipping/rounding effects in either test-case generation or oracle evaluation.)"
