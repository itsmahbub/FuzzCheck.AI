  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by analyzing statistical failure patterns, specifically the transferability of its generated jailbreak prompts across different models and the universality across different malicious requests. The authors observe that the semantically meaningful prompts generated by their method (AutoDAN) are more effective at causing failures (successful jailbreaks) on models they were not optimized for (transferability) compared to the baseline. They provide a diagnostic hypothesis for this observed pattern, speculating that by optimizing at the semantic/lexical level rather than the token-gradient level, their method generates more general attacks that exploit 'common flaws for language models' and avoid 'overfitting on white-box models'. This analysis moves beyond simply reporting failure rates and provides insight into the nature of the vulnerabilities being exploited, qualifying it for a 'Medium' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 8, Section 4.2, Transferability. 'AutoDAN exhibits a much better transferability in attacking the black-box LLMs compared with the baseline. We speculate that the potential reason is the semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts may be inherently more transferable than the methods based on tokens' gradients. As GCG-like method directly optimizes the jailbreak prompt by the gradient information, it is likely for the algorithm to get relatively overfitting in the white-box model. On the contrary, since lexical-level data such as words usually cannot be updated according to specific gradient information, optimizing at the lexical-level may make it easier to generate the more general jailbreak prompts, which may be common flaws for language models.'"
