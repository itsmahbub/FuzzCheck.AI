  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's DeepTest method uncovers many unsafe, high-impact functional failures (steering-angle deviations that can lead to potentially fatal crashes) and reports thousands of such erroneous behaviors in evaluated driving models. However, the evaluation targets standard Udacity driving models and the paper does not claim or demonstrate bypassing explicit safety, policy, or security mechanisms (e.g., adversarially-trained or safety-aligned models) nor uncover attacks like data leakage or jailbreaks. Therefore the failures exposed violate user safety expectations (unsafe steering) but do not show bypassing of explicit defenses, matching the 'Medium' category.",
  "evidence": "Page 303, Abstract: \"DeepTest found thousands of erroneous behaviors under different realistic driving conditions (e.g., blurring, rain, fog, etc.) many of which lead to potentially fatal crashes in three top performing DNNs in the Udacity self-driving car challenge.\"; Page 306, Section 3.4 (Creating a Test Oracle with Metamorphic Relations): \"the autonomous car’s steering angle should not change significantly for the same image under any lighting/weather conditions, blurring, or any affine transformations with small parameter values.\"; Page 311, Results / RQ4: \"In total, DeepTest detects 6339 erroneous behaviors across all three models.\"; Page 308, Section 4 (Implementation): \"We evaluate our techniques on three DNN models that won top positions in the Udacity self-driving challenge ... Rambo, Chauffeur, and Epoch.\" (no mention of testing defended/adversarially-trained or safety-aligned models or bypassing explicit safety or security mechanisms)"
