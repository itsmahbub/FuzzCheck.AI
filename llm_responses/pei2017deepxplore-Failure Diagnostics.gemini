  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic analysis that links discovered failures to underlying model vulnerabilities, specifically dataset bias or pollution. In Section 7.3, the authors conduct an experiment where they use the generated error-inducing inputs to identify mislabeled data within a polluted training set. They generate inputs that cause a discrepancy between a model trained on clean data and one trained on polluted data. Then, by finding the training samples most similar to these error-inducing inputs, they successfully identify the polluted data points. This demonstrates a method for tracing discovered failures back to a specific, underlying vulnerability (dataset pollution), thereby explaining why these failures occur.",
  "evidence": "Page 15, Section 7.3, 'Detecting training data pollution attack': 'As another application of DeepXplore, we demonstrate how it can be used to detect training data pollution attacks with an experiment on two LeNet-5 DNNs: one trained on 60, 000 hand-written digits from MNIST dataset and the other trained on an artificially polluted version of the same dataset where 30% of the images originally labeled as digit 9 are mislabeled as 1. We use DeepXplore to generate error-inducing inputs that are classified as the digit 9 and 1 by the unpolluted and polluted versions of the LeNet-5 DNN respectively. We then search for samples in the training set that are closest to the inputs generated by DeepXplore in terms of structural similarity [80] and identify them as polluted data. Using this process, we are able to correctly identify 95.6% of the polluted samples.'"
