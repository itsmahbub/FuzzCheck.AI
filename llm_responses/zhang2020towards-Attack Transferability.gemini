  "why": "The paper evaluates whether the 'uncommon data' generated for an original model can bypass defense techniques that involve retraining the model (e.g., defensive distillation and label smoothing). The authors explicitly describe this as a 'transfer attack scenario', thus testing if the generated inputs (fault-inducing inputs) transfer to a different but related model. However, the proposed generation method, KuK, is not explicitly designed to discover transferable attacks. Its genetic algorithm is guided by fitness functions based on the uncertainty metrics of a single target model, without incorporating mechanisms to generalize the attack across multiple models.",
  "evidence": "Page 11, Section 5.2 RQ4: Evaluation on Defense Techniques, 'For other defense techniques, the reduction in success rate appears smaller than that of binary classifier and mutation-based detection. For example, the success rates drop to 78.3% and 76.2% for defensive distillation and label smoothing on NIN. The reason is that a new model is retrained with these defense techniques, while the attacks are generated regarding to the original one, making it a more challenging transfer attack scenario. For example, defensive distillation retrains a more robust model by reducing the gradients. In this case, some of the data, which are uncommon for original model, become common data w.r.t. the retrained model, because of some weight variation. However, it still can be seen from the results that the uncommon data reveal stronger transferability.'"
