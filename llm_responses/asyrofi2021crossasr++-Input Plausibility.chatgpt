  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "CrossASR++ generates test inputs via TTS and enforces a plausibility-based filter in its differential-testing logic: an audio is counted as a failed test case for the System Under Test (SUT) only if the SUT fails but at least one other ASR recognizes the audio correctly. This implicitly filters out wholly implausible/invalid TTS outputs (which the paper calls \"indeterminable\"). The paper also explicitly discusses that better TTSes produce fewer invalid/indeterminable audios and that indeterminable cases exist. However, the paper does not provide explicit perceptual or task-specific quantitative assessments (e.g., PESQ, STOI, human evaluation, or other audio-quality/intelligibility metrics) of the final fault-inducing audios. Because CrossASR++ therefore enforces plausibility via cross-referencing (a form of validation of final inputs) but lacks dedicated empirical perceptual/quality evaluation, the appropriate rating is Medium.",
  "evidence": "Section 2.1 Workflow (p.1576): \"For a piece of audio and its corresponding transcription, there are three possible situations: 1) if the SUT can recognize it successfully... 2) If the SUT fails to recognize the audio file successfully, but at least one of the other ASR systems succeeds, we take this audio file (and the corresponding input text) as a failed test case for the SUT. 3) If all the ASR systems cannot recognize the audio correctly, we call it an indeterminable test case because a TTS may generate an invalid audio.\" (Section 2.1, Workflow, p.1576) Section 2.2 Extensibility (p.1576): \"The main reason is that more advanced TTSes generate fewer invalid audios that are more likely to be indeterminable test cases.\" (Section 2.2, p.1576) Section 3 Experiments (p.1577): experimental evaluation focuses on counts of \"# Failed Test Case\" and ablation of features (visibility, added ASRs, estimators) — no reported perceptual or speech-quality / intelligibility metrics or human evaluation is provided in the experiments or results tables (e.g., Tables 1–3 measure numbers of failed test cases). (Section 3, RQ1/RQ2, p.1577)"
