  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper evaluates QATest by applying its metamorphic transformations and guidance criteria separately to multiple QA systems (UnifiedQA, ALBERT, DrQA, MARL), but it does not present any experiments in which fault-inducing inputs crafted on one model are reused to test other models, nor does it describe design elements intended to discover or prioritize transferable attacks across models. The testing guidance (N-Gram coverage and perplexity priority) and seed selection are aimed at diversity and authenticity of generated questions, not at identifying inputs that transfer across different model implementations. Consequently, the paper does not demonstrate attack transferability as defined by the metric.",
  "evidence": "1) Abstract (page 1, Abstract): \"To evaluate the performance of QATest, we experiment with it on four QA systems that are designed for different tasks. The experiment results show that the tests generated by QATest detect hundreds of erroneous behaviors of QA systems efficiently.\" — indicates per-system evaluation but does not claim cross-model reuse. \n\n2) Section 4.1 (page 7, \"Research Questions\"): The four RQs listed are RQ1 (Metamorphic Transformations), RQ2 (Testing Criteria), RQ3 (Test Diversity), and RQ4 (Case Study). None ask about or evaluate transferability across models: \"RQ1 (Metamorphic Transformations): How effective are different transformation methods for generating tests for various types of QA systems?... RQ4 (Case Study): Analysis of the bug types detected by QATest.\" \n\n3) Section 4.2.2 (page 8, \"QA systems\"): \"To evaluate the performance of QATest, we select four state-of-art QA systems as the testing subjects in our experiments. We briefly introduce them as follows: UnifiedQA ..., ALBERT ..., DrQA ..., MARL ...\" — shows multiple target systems but no description of crafting faults on one and reusing them on others. \n\n4) Section 3.3 (page 4, \"Guidance Criteria Design\") and Section 3.3.1/3.3.2 (N-Gram Coverage / Perplexity Priority): These criteria are defined to improve test diversity and authenticity (e.g., \"N-Gram coverage... select the particular question that can increase the richness of the seed set\" and \"perplexity priority... to ensure that the generated test questions have good authenticity\"), with no mention of mechanisms to identify or prioritize inputs likely to transfer across models."
