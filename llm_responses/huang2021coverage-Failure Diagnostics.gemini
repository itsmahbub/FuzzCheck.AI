  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight into discovered failures by analyzing them through two primary lenses described in the metric. First, it correlates failures (both adversarial samples and backdoor attacks) with observable model internals, demonstrating that these failures correspond to an increase in the proposed coverage metrics, which capture new internal model behaviors. Second, it conducts a statistical analysis of failure patterns, specifically examining the diversity and distribution of the generated adversarial samples in the input space and comparing them to those generated by gradient-based attack methods. This analysis characterizes the nature of the discovered failures but does not extend to linking them to underlying root causes like dataset bias or spurious features, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 10, Section VII-C.1, Searching for Adversarial Samples (RQ3): \"Fig. 5 reveals that normal perturbed samples can only satisfy part of test conditions, whereas the rest are more sensitive to the adversarial samples. In all the plots, coverage of RNN test metrics can be further increased in consideration of adversarial samples. A more obvious example is, the TC coverage of IMDB model tend to saturate in the left side when only normal perturbed samples are utilized. In the right side, the coverage curve becomes steep, indicating the discovery of test cases capturing new internal behaviors.\"\n\nPage 12, Section VII-E, Comparison With Attack-Based Defect Detection (RQ6): \"We can see from the resulting diversity measurement and visualization that compared to attack methods, our testing method exercises different behaviors of RNN and generates a diverse set of test cases, intensively covering the input region around the seed input. This ability will be helpful in exposing more types of defects of the RNN (not merely in the gradient direction).\""
