  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight based on observable model internals (hypervector similarity/distance) and statistical failure patterns (per-class L1/L2 distances and average fuzzing iterations). HDTest explicitly uses cosine-similarity between query and class hypervectors to guide fuzzing and reports per-class statistics and sample-level \"vulnerable cases.\" However, the paper does not offer deeper causal analysis that links failures to underlying model vulnerabilities such as reliance on non-robust or spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting, so it does not meet the ‘High’ level.",
  "evidence": "Section IV (HDTest Framework), p.393: \"The fitness of seeds are defined as: fitness = 1 - Cosim(AM[y], HDC(seed)), where AM[y] is the reference vector in the associative memory and HDC(seed) is the query HV of the seed, encoded by the HDC model.\"; Section V.B (Mutation Strategies Analysis), p.394: \"Such vulnerable cases bring potential security loopholes since they can result in incorrect behaviors of HDC models by only minor and even negligible perturbations. Therefore, such images should be emphasized when defending attacks to the HDC systems, and HDTest is able to pinpoint and highlight them.\"; Section V.C (Per-class Analysis), p.395: \"We then perform a per-class analysis on L1/L2 distance and fuzzing iterations as shown in Fig. 7. We can observe that for some classes such as '1', the average fuzzing iteration is drastically higher ... For other classes such as '9', the average fuzzing iteration is lower.\"; Section V.C (Per-class Analysis), p.395: \"Moreover, we do not observe apparent relation between fuzzing iteration and distance metrics.\""
