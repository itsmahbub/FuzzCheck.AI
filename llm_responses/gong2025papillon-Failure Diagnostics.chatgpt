  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides substantial statistical analysis of failure patterns (e.g., attack success rate changes across prompt length, mutator variants, pre-jailbreak budgets, judges, defenses, and cross-model transferability) and links some failure modes to observable input properties (notably prompt perplexity and semantic coherence) that enable evasion of detection. However, it does not analyze internal model signals (neuron activations, coverage, logits, layer behavior) nor does it explicitly link failures to deeper underlying model vulnerabilities such as dataset bias or overfitting. Therefore the paper meets the 'Medium' level: it offers statistical/failure-pattern diagnostics but not analysis of model internals or causes like spurious features or training data issues.",
  "evidence": "Section 4.2 (Maintain semantic coherence), p.2408–2409: \"Experiments show that the average perplexity of our generated jailbreak prompts for GPT-3.5 Turbo is as low as 34.61, significantly below the average perplexity threshold of 58.83.\"; Section 6.1 (Perplexity Filter), p.2411–2412: \"As shown in Table 16 (appendix), when applying the perplexity filter [1] to PAPILLON, we observe that PAPILLON maintains a high attack success rate. The ASR drop of PAPILLON is less than 10% in nearly all cases. The potential reason is that the jailbreak prompts generated by PAPILLON maintain semantic coherence with low perplexity. This allows these jailbreak prompts to bypass the perplexity-based detection mechanism by closely mimicking regular, benign prompts, thus evading detection.\"; Section 5.3 (Ablation Studies) and Tables (e.g., Table 11, Table 12, Table 15, Table 16, Table 17), pp.2410–2420: the paper reports systematic experiments showing how ASR/AQ vary with mutator combinations, pre-jailbreak budget, prompt length, defenses, and cross-model transferability (statistical failure patterns) but contains no analysis of model internals (neurons, coverage) or explicit attribution of failures to dataset bias/overfitting."
