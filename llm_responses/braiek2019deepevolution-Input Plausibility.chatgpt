  "value": "High",
  "why": "The paper enforces plausibility constraints both in the mutation design and in candidate selection: transformation parameters are manually tuned to valid domain intervals (defining a constrained sub-space of exploration), the compound transformation limits affine changes (only one affine transform) to avoid unrealistic images, and mutated inputs with low perceptual similarity are rejected using SSIM. The authors also report an empirical plausibility check: they sampled generated images (95% confidence, 5% error) and verified them manually. These points show plausibility is enforced throughout the search and that final generated inputs were assessed quantitatively (SSIM) and via manual inspection.",
  "evidence": "Section IV.A (Metamorphic Transformation), p.455: \"To infer the valid domain interval of each transformation’s parameters, we manually tune them to set up the appropriate range of values, i.e., high and low boundaries, that preserves the input semantics before and after each transformation... To verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original inputs, we compute a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [8]... Therefore, we reject mutated synthetic inputs for which SSIM values are lower than a tuned threshold.\"; Section IV.C (Swarm-based Metaheuristics), p.456: \"To ensure semantically preserving transformations, we use the valid domain intervals of transformations that we have already tuned manually to create the high and low boundaries vectors, defining the sub-space of exploration.\"; Section VI (Threats to Validity), p.457: \"The manual tuning of metamorphic transformations’ domain and the threshold of SSIM could affect the validity of our results. To mitigate this threat, we selected a sample of our generated images using a confidence level of 95% and an error margin of 5%, and verified them manually. We found them to be correct.\""
