  "value": "Low",
  "why": "Although the authors apply LipFuzzer separately to both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant vApp platforms, they do not generate fault-inducing inputs on one platform and then reuse those exact inputs to test the other. The evaluation treats each platform in isolation, and the paper does not include any explicit experiment or analysis showing that LAPSUS examples found on a surrogate (e.g., Alexa) transfer to an unseen target (e.g., Google Assistant). Thus, it does not demonstrate cross-model transferability of specific fault-inducing inputs.",
  "evidence": "Section VI–C (vApp Store Evaluation, pp. 12–13): the authors describe running LipFuzzer “by using templates crawled from the Amazon Alexa Store” and “templates crawled from the Google Assistant Store” but do not report reusing the same LAPSUS across both platforms.  Section VI (Evaluation Goals, p. 11): none of the three stated goals mention testing the transfer of inputs from one model to another."
