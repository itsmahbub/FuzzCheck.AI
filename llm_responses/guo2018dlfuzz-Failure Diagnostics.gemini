  "why": "The paper provides diagnostic insight by analyzing observable model internals. The core methodology of DLFuzz is designed to guide the search for failures (adversarial examples) by maximizing neuron coverage. The authors propose and evaluate four distinct heuristic strategies for selecting specific neurons to activate based on their internal characteristics, such as activation frequency, weights, and proximity to the activation threshold. This approach explicitly connects the discovery of erroneous behaviors to the internal state of the model. The evaluation also analyzes the effectiveness of these neuron selection strategies in improving neuron coverage, further strengthening the link between model internals and failure discovery. The paper does not, however, conduct a deeper analysis to explain why these failures occur by linking them to underlying vulnerabilities like spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting, which would be required for a 'High' rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 4, Section 'Strategies for Neuron Selection': 'To maximize neuron coverage, we propose four heuristic strategies for selecting neurons more likely to improve coverage. For each seed xs, m neurons will be selected utilizing one or multiple strategies... (1) Strategy 1. Select neurons covered frequently during past testing. Inspired by practical experience in traditional software testing that code fragments often or rarely executed are more possible to introduce defects. Neurons covered often or rarely perhaps can result in unusual logic and activate more neurons. (2) Strategy 2. Select neurons covered rarely... (3) Strategy 3. Select neurons with top weights... (4) Strategy 4. Select neurons near the activation threshold.'"
