  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides substantive diagnostic insight based on observable model internals and statistical failure patterns, but stops short of attributing discovered failures to deeper underlying vulnerabilities (e.g., specific spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting) in a principled, per-failure manner. Specifically, the authors design NLC around layer-wise distributional signals (variance, covariance, density, shape) and use those internal signals to (a) explain why their criterion responds to certain inputs, (b) correlate coverage with fault-revealing capability, and (c) distinguish types of failures (e.g., adversarial/dissimilarity effects). They also report statistical analyses of failure distributions (class coverage, entropy) and controlled experiments showing which criteria respond to adversarial perturbations vs. genuine fault-revealing inputs. However, the paper does not perform detailed root-cause analyses that link individual failures to concrete model vulnerabilities such as reliance on particular non-robust features, dataset bias, or overfitting (beyond a brief discussion/usage of texture-blur/stylize to probe texture-bias). Therefore the work meets the metric requirement for Medium: it provides diagnostic insight via observable internals and statistical patterns but not full explanatory links to underlying vulnerabilities.",
  "evidence": "IV. DESIGN OF NEURAL COVERAGE (p.1204): \"NLC captures four key properties of distributions: divergence, correlation, shape, and density, which corresponds to the first four criteria in Table I.\"; Measuring activation/variance (p.1204–1205): \"NLC directly measures how divergent (i.e., how active) the neuron output is in its continuous form by calculating the following variance: σ²_n = E[(o−E[o])(o−E[o])].\"; Characterizing correlation (p.1204–1205): \"Similarly, we use the covariance, a common metric for joint variability of two variables, to characterize the correlation between two neurons... Σ = [σ²_n1  ς_n1,n2;  ς_n2,n1  σ²_n2].\"; Responding to density change (p.1205): \"We thus state that our criterion can respond to density change which is possibly introduced by corner-case behaviors and new major behaviors.\"; VI-A2 Fault-Revealing (p.1208): \"Table VI shows that NLC is strongly and positively correlated to the fault-revealing capability of a test suite.\"; Correlation to 'Out-of-Bound' (p.1208): \"KMNC has no response to AEs, but NBC and SNAC respond notably, because AEs primarily lead to out-of-range neuron outputs. NLC measures how divergent a layer output is and responds to the density change of layer outputs.\"; Adversarial-control observation (p.1208–1209): \"This is an important observation, indicating that NBC/SNAC/DSC do not accurately reflect the fault-revealing capability. Instead, they are sensitive to the 'dissimilarity' induced by adversarial perturbations...\"; Use of transformations to probe a known bias (p.1209, VI-B setup): \"blurring and stylizing (see Fig. 9) reveal the texture-bias (i.e., rely on texture to make decisions) of DNNs [7, 14].\"; Statistical analysis of failure patterns / diversity (p.1209–1210): \"Overall, a collection of fault-triggering images are regarded as more diverse if they cover more classes... we further use the scaled entropy... to assess the diversity.\""
