  "why": "The paper's fuzzer (KuK) steers test generation by optimizing uncertainty-based objectives (PCS and VRO) to produce uncommon inputs and to cause misclassification (AEs) or produce benign examples with particular uncertainty patterns. Its objectives and fitness functions are defined in terms of prediction confidence and Bayesian uncertainty (PCS, VRO) and in some cases an AE/BE indicator, but nowhere does KuK attempt to force a particular attacker-chosen output label or specific target prediction. Thus the exploration is untargeted with respect to attacker-selected outputs and instead discovers generic failures (adversarial examples / misclassifications and unusual uncertainty-pattern inputs).",
  "evidence": "Page 740, Introduction: \"we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) based automated test generation technique that iteratively generates uncommon input samples guided by uncertainty metrics. We implement the proposed technique as a tool named KuK (to Know the UnKnown)...\" (Sec. 1).; Page 744, Sec. 3.3 (Characterizing Data Behavior): \"we adopt a two-dimensional metric, i.e., (PCS, VRO), to characterize the BEs and AEs on a specific DNN model. Based on this, the data is classified into four patterns ... LH, HH, LL and HL.\"; Page 746, Sec. 4 (Objective and Fitness Calculation): \"To generate AEs which belong to the HL type, the objective is set as: PCS(x, M) > p ∧ VRO(x, M) < v ∧ x is an AE, where p and v are the configurable parameters...\" (Eq. 3) — objective specified by uncertainty metrics and AE status, not by a target label; Page 746, Sec. 4 (also Eq. 4): \"To generate BEs that belong to LH type, the objective is set as: PCS(x, M) < p ∧ VRO(x, M) > v and x is a BE\" — again objectives are uncertainty-pattern based rather than steering toward attacker-chosen outputs."
