  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper provides statistical and empirical diagnostic analysis of failures (e.g., per-model ASR/EASR, transferability patterns across models, ablations of seed-selection and mutator choices, and oracle accuracy), which gives insight into where and when jailbreaks succeed. However, it does not analyze observable model internals (neuron activations, layer behavior, coverage metrics) nor does it link discovered failures to deeper model vulnerabilities such as reliance on non-robust/spurious features, dataset bias, or overfitting. Thus it goes beyond mere reporting (so not Low) but stops short of the causal, internal-model explanations required for a High rating.",
  "evidence": "Page 4661, Section 3.1 (Problem/Threat Model): \"In our case, the fuzzing target is an LLM that remains beyond our control. Our only means of assessment is analyzing the LLM’s response to determine if an undesired output has been generated. Consequently, we need an efficient and effective method for discerning the harmfulness of the response.\"; Page 4666, Section 4.3 (Experiment Result): \"Figure 4 also sheds light on the performance of our method when applied to jailbreak commercial models. A notable observation is that our method exhibits the worst performance on Gemini, a very recent commercial model, with a significantly lower EASR and ASR. This underperformance could be attributed to the extensive red-teaming that Gemini has likely undergone, reflecting the increasing emphasis on model safety by producers of commercial LLMs.\"; Page 4664, Section 4.3 (Experiment I results / Table 1): \"As illustrated in Table 1, our fuzzing process reveals intriguing insights. Among the 100 unethical questions where human-written templates all failed to jailbreak gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, our fuzzer was capable of generating templates to assist on average 96.85 questions in achieving their jailbreaking objectives through template mutations.\"; Page 4667, Section 5 (Discussion - Limitations): \"The success of LLM-FUZZER partially relies on the oracle’s ability to accurately determine whether a response constitutes a jailbreak. We utilized a RoBERTa model as our oracle, and while it has proven effective, its accuracy is not 100% as shown in Table 3. The potential for misclassification presents a challenge, as false positives or negatives could misguide the fuzzing process.\""
