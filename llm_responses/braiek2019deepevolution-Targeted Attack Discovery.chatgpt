  "why": "DeepEvolution is driven by coverage-maximizing fitness and metamorphic transformations to increase input diversity and reveal misclassifications or model divergences (e.g., after quantization). The paper repeatedly describes goals such as increasing neuronal coverage, finding misclassified synthetic inputs, and exposing difference-inducing inputs between original and quantized models. There is no description of steering the search toward attacker-chosen specific outputs (e.g., a particular target label or phrase) or an oracle that enforces a predefined target output; instead the method performs untargeted exploration to reveal generic failures.",
  "evidence": "Abstract (page 454): \"DeepEvolution aims to detect inconsistencies and potential defects in DNN models\"; \"Using a coverage-based fitness function to guide the exploration process; it aims to ensure a maximum diversity in the generated test cases.\" (Abstract, p.454)\n\nIII. DEEPEVOLUTION: TESTING WORKFLOW (page 455): \"From one generation of candidates to another, DeepEvolution performs follow-up tests with the resulting transformed inputs and stores the failed tests that exhibit erroneous DNNs behavior or induce a divergence between the original DNN and its quantized version.\" (Section III, p.455)\n\nIV.B DNN Coverage (page 455): \"We define the following fitness function: Fitness = α × NLNC + β × NGNC\" — the fitness is explicitly coverage-based (local and global neuron coverage), showing the search objective is coverage rather than a specific target output. (Section IV.B, p.455)\n\nV.C RQ2 (page 456): \"The objective is to assess the effectiveness of our approach in testing the robustness of the DNN; by finding misclassified synthetic inputs.\" and \"DeepEvolution can effectively generate test cases that trigger erroneous behaviors of the DNN.\" (Section V, RQ2, p.456)\n\nV.D RQ3 (page 456–457): The evaluation compares the number of \"difference-inducing inputs\" that expose quantization defects vs. TensorFuzz, again showing the goal is to find generic divergences rather than attacker-specified outputs. (Section V.D, p.456-457)"
