  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper explicitly designs and enforces per-mutation plausibility constraints (resource-based parameterization, preconditions, perspective and lighting checks) and it performs an explicit human validation of final fault-inducing inputs. However, the implementation still produces a substantial rate of non-conforming (false-positive) mutants, the authors report limitations of automated conformity checks (failed discriminator), and they do not address cumulative drift across multiple iterative mutations. Thus the work enforces plausibility at the individual-mutation level and validates final cases empirically, but does not fully ensure plausibility throughout iterative fuzzing and exhibits imperfect conformity enforcement.",
  "evidence": "Section 3.2 (p.1960): \"Second, we associate a set of preconditions Prec with each mutation δ, specified in terms of the interp that defines whether δ is applicable to a given t. If Prec(interp) is not satisfied, then δ is not applicable to that test.\" (Section name: 3.2 Semantic Mutations with semSensFuzz) \n\nSection 4.3.1 (p.1963): \"To ensure that the lighting conditions are similar, if the entity does not have a median value within 5 units (~2%) of the median value of the base image target area, then it fails the conformity check.\" (Section name: 4.3 Adding an Entity / Implementation) \n\nSection 4.3.1 (p.1962–1963): description of multiple conformity checks (vanishing point quadrant matching, bounding-box-on-road check, occlusion filtering) used before generating a mutated image. (Section name: 4.3 Adding an Entity / Implementation) \n\nSection 4.4.4 (p.1964): \"We explored this approach, training a binary classifier based on a CNN ... The discriminator learned to differentiate between the classes, but could not differentiate conforming versus nonconforming images.\" (Section name: 4.4.4 Discriminators for Conformity Checking) \n\nSection 6.4.1 and Table 2 (p.1966–1967): human-validation of plausibility: \"we manually inspect all the generated test cases that led to 5+ p.p. drop, and sample 10% of the test cases that led to a drop between 1 and 5 p.p.. The process entailed each author examining each image and classifying them as either a true positive or false positive.\" Table 2 (p.1967) reports substantial false-positive rates (e.g., EfficientPS: 43% for [1,5) p.p., 47% for [5,10), 53% for [10,100]). (Section name: 6.4.1 RQ1 Results: Finding Inconsistencies) \n\nSection 4.3.2 and Figures 9 (p.1963): authors enumerate concrete failure modes leading to nonconforming images (perspective mismatch, overlapping entities, inconsistent lighting, missing shadows). (Section name: 4.3 Adding an Entity / Potential for False Positives) \n\nSection 3.2 (p.1960): \"All of the mechanisms in our approach make a conscious trade off between conformity and a smaller space of available mutations.\" (Section name: 3.2 Semantic Mutations with semSensFuzz)"
