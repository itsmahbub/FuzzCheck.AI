  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "While the paper conducts extensive statistical analyses of failure patterns (per-model and per-category jailbreak rates, transfer experiments, ablations on attacker strategies and defenses), it does not delve into internal model diagnostics such as neuron activations, coverage metrics, or mechanistic attribution to non-robust or spurious features. This matches the “Medium” level: the authors provide rich statistical and ablation insights into when and where PAIR succeeds or fails, but they do not analyze observable model internals to explain why these failures occur at the representation level.",
  "evidence": "• Section IV-A, IV-B, IV-C, IV-E: Statistical analyses of jailbreak success rates across models, categories, defenses, and attacker-design ablations (Tables III, IV, VIII; Figure 4).  \n• Section IV-B (p.28): Hypothesis that transferability arises from shared training data vulnerabilities—an untested, high-level linkage rather than measured internal bias analysis.  \n• No sections present neuron-level, layer-wise, or coverage-based investigations, nor do they attribute failures to specific spurious features or dataset biases via model internals."
