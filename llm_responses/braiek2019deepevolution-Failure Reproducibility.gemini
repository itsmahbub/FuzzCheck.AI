  "value": "Medium",
  "why": "The paper's proposed method, DeepEvolution, relies on applying a set of semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations to generate new test inputs. These transformations include pixel-value changes (contrast, brightness, blur) and affine transformations (rotation, scaling). The metric definition explicitly states that a method that 'applies semantic-preserving metamorphic transformations without explicit enforcement of reproducibility under serialization' should be rated as 'Medium'. While the paper ensures that the transformed inputs are semantically similar to the originals using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), it does not describe any mechanism to explicitly account for I/O effects such as rounding or clipping that occur when saving an in-memory floating-point representation of an image to a standard integer-based file format. The transformations are defined over continuous parameter ranges, and there is no discussion of whether the precise numerical perturbations that might trigger a failure would persist after serialization.",
  "evidence": "Page 455, Section IV-A, 'Metamorphic Transformation': 'First, we gather a list of parametric image-based transformations that can be organised in two groups: 1) Pixel-value transformations: change image contrast, image brightness, image blur, image sharpness and random perturbations within a limited interval. 2) Affine transformations: image translation, image scaling, image shearing, and image rotation.' and 'To verify that generated inputs remain semantically equivalent to the original inputs, we compute a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [8] which assesses the similarity between two images based on the visual impact of three characteristics: luminance, contrast, and structure.'"
