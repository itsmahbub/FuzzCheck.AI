  "value": "Low",
  "why": "The paper's fuzzing design does not explicitly account for standard I/O serialization effects (rounding/quantization/format encoding). The implemented image mutations are adding white noise and optional L∞-bounded perturbations followed by clipping to the training input range, but there is no handling or checking that fault-inducing perturbations survive common serialization steps (e.g., 8-bit PNG/JPEG quantization or file encoding). The only use of quantization in the paper is quantizing model weights/activations (32-bit → 16-bit) to compare model disagreement, which is a model-internal quantization rather than input serialization handling. Because TensorFuzz neither constrains mutations to be robust under typical I/O quantization/rounding nor evaluates failures after serialization, failures it finds may rely on fragile in-memory numerical perturbations that would be lost when inputs are serialized. This matches the metric definition for Low (ignores I/O effects during mutation and oracle evaluation).",
  "evidence": "Section 5 (Mutator): \"For image inputs, we implemented two different types of mutation. The first is to just add white noise ... The second is to add white noise, but to constrain the difference ... to have a user-configurable L∞ norm. ... In both types of image mutation we clip the image after mutation so that it lies in the same range as the inputs used to train the neural network being fuzzed.\" (Section 5, \"Mutator\")\n\nSection 4 (Overview of the TensorFuzz Library): \"If the inputs are images, we restrict our inputs to have the correct size and shape, and to lie in the same interval as the input pixels of the dataset under consideration.\" (Section 4, \"Overview of the fuzzing procecure\")\n\nSection 6 (Quantization experiment): \"We then truncated all weights and activations to 16-bits. We then compared the predictions of the 32-bit and the 16-bit model ...\" — this describes quantization of model internals, not input serialization handling. (Section 6, \"TensorFuzz surfaces disagreements between models and their quantized versions\")\n\nNowhere in the paper do the authors describe serializing mutated inputs to common on-disk formats (PNG/JPEG/WAV/MP3) or explicitly modeling/handling rounding, clipping, or encoding effects during test generation or oracle evaluation; the paper only describes clipping to the input value range and L∞ constraints (Sections 4 and 5). (See Sections 4 and 5 for mutation/clip descriptions and Section 6 for the separate model quantization experiment.)"
