  "why": "The paper enforces input plausibility during fuzzing via an explicit distance constraint (Constraint(I,I')) and by tuning mutation parameters (e.g., η1) to limit drift; the authors also report maintaining the L2 distance between original and mutated images (≈0.05) during experiments and note that some adversarial images were \"visually indistinguishable\" from originals. However, the paper does not provide an explicit empirical assessment of the perceptual or semantic realism of the final fault-inducing inputs using human studies or task-specific quantitative measures (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS, PESQ, STOI, Perplexity). Therefore it enforces plausibility at mutation time and validates it qualitatively, but lacks rigorous quantitative / human-evaluation evidence required for a High rating.",
  "evidence": "Section 2.3 (Algorithm discussion), p.166: \"For example, Constraint(I, I') is true if L2 distance between I and I' is less than a certain threshold.\"; Section 3.2 (Hyperparameters), p.169: \"The second hyper-parameter η1 is the number of times that the set of selected neurons is used for generating new inputs... We manually set the η1 to 3 so that the distance is not too far.\"; Section 4.1 (Experimental setup), p.170: \"All the techniques, including Adapt, performed testing while maintaining the L2-distance between the initial and mutated inputs within 0.05 on average.\"; Section 4.3 (Adversarial Inputs), p.172: \"...the adversarial images found for VGG-19 and ResNet-50 were visually indistinguishable from the original ones.\""
